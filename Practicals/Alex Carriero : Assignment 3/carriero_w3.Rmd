## Working with equations

We define as set of equations as: 

\begin{gather}
a = b + c^2,\\
a- c^2 = b, \\
\mathrm{left \ side} = \mathrm{right \ side}, \\
\mathrm{left \ side} + \mathrm{something} \geq \mathrm{right \ side},
\end{gather}

for all something $> 0$. 

## Aligning the same equations 

Aligning the equations by the equal sign gives a much better view into the placements
of the separate equation components.

\begin{align}
a &= b + c^2\\
a- c^2 &= b \\
\mathrm{left \ side} &= \mathrm{right \ side} \\
\mathrm{left \ side} + \mathrm{something} &\geq \mathrm{right \ side}
\end{align}


## Omit equations numbering 

Alternatively, the equation numbering can be omitted.

\begin{align*}
a &= b + c^2\\
a- c^2 &= b \\
\mathrm{left \ side} &= \mathrm{right \ side} \\
\mathrm{left \ side} + \mathrm{something} &\geq \mathrm{right \ side}
\end{align*}


## Ugly alignment 

Some components do not look well, when aligned. Especially equations with different
heights and spacing. For example,

\begin{align}
E &= mc^2,\\
m &= \frac{E}{c^2},\\
c &= \sqrt{\frac{E}{m}}.
\end{align}

Take that into account.

## Discussion

This is where youâ€™d normally give your audience a recap of your talk, where you could
discuss e.g. the following

- Your main findings
- The consequences of your main findings
- Things to do
- Any other business not currently investigated, but related to your talk
