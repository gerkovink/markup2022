  abstract = {In this paper we revisit the relationship between democracy, redistribution, and inequality. We first explain the theoretical reasons why democracy is expected to increase redistribution and reduce inequality, and why this expectation may fail to be realized when democracy is captured by the richer segments of the population; when it caters to the preferences of the middle class; or when it opens up disequalizing opportunities to segments of the population previously excluded from such activities, thus exacerbating inequality among a large part of the population. We then survey the existing empirical literature, which is both voluminous and full of contradictory results. We provide new and systematic reduced-form evidence on the dynamic impact of democracy on various outcomes. Our findings indicate that there is a significant and robust effect of democracy on tax revenues as a fraction of GDP, but no robust impact on inequality. We also find that democracy is associated with an increase in secondary schooling and a more rapid structural transformation. Finally, we provide some evidence suggesting that inequality tends to increase after democratization when the economy has already undergone significant structural transformation, when land inequality is high, and when the gap between the middle class and the poor is small. All of these are broadly consistent with a view that is different from the traditional median voter model of democratic redistribution: democracy does not lead to a uniform decline in post-tax inequality, but can result in changes in fiscal redistribution and economic structure that have ambiguous effects on inequality.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements in signal processing (SP) and machine learning, coupled with electronic medical record keeping in hospitals and the availability of extensive sets of medical images through internal/external communication systems, have resulted in a recent surge of interest in radiomics. Radiomics, an emerging and relatively new research field, refers to extracting semiquantitative and/or quantitative features from medical images with the goal of developing predictive and/or prognostic models. In the near future, it is expected to be a critical component for integrating image-derived information used for personalized treatment. The conventional radiomics workflow is typically based on extracting predesigned features (also referred to as handcrafted or engineered features) from a segmented region of interest (ROI). Nevertheless, recent advancements in deep learning have inspired trends toward deep-learning-based radiomics (DLRs) (also referred to as discovery radiomics). In addition to the advantages of these two approaches, there are also hybrid solutions that exploit the potential of multiple data sources. Considering the variety of approaches to radiomics, further improvements require a comprehensive and integrated sketch, which is the goal of this article. This article provides a unique interdisciplinary perspective on radiomics by discussing state-of-the-art SP solutions in the context of radiomics.},

But the composition of income in equilibrium depends on tax policies. We show how the interaction between social beliefs and welfare policies may lead to multiple equilibria or multiple steady states. If a society believes that individual effort determines income, and that all have a right to enjoy the fruits of their effort, it will choose low redistribution and low taxes. In equilibrium, effort will be high and the role of luck will be limited, in which case market outcomes will be relatively fair and social beliefs will be self-fulfilled. If, instead, a society believes that luck, birth, connections, and/or corruption determine wealth, it will levy high taxes, thus distorting allocations and making these beliefs self-sustained as well. These insights may help explain the cross-country variation in perceptions about income inequality and choices of redistributive policies.},

Discussing various possible economic explanations for the difference, they cover different levels of pre-tax income, openness, and social mobility; they survey politico-historical differences such as the varying physical size of nations, their electoral and legal systems, and the character of their political parties, as well as their experiences of war; and they examine sociological explanations, which include different attitudes to the poor and notions of social responsibility. Most importantly, they address attitudes to race, calculating that attitudes to race explain half the observed difference in levels of public redistribution of income. This important and provocative analysis will captivate academic and serious lay readers in economics and welfare systems.},

Economic models suggest that redistribution is a function of the variance and skewness of the pre-tax income distribution, the volatility of income (perhaps because of trade shocks), the social costs of taxation and the expected income mobility of the median voter. None of these factors appear to explain the differences between the US and Europe. Instead, the differences appear to be the result of racial heterogeneity in the US and American political institutions. Racial animosity in the US makes redistribution to the poor, who are disproportionately black, unappealing to many voters. American political institutions limited the growth of a socialist party, and more generally limited the political power of the poor.},

The former is assumed to provide fairer representation but at a cost in terms of stability and effectiveness. Recent work by Lijphart and others suggests that not only are PR-based (consensus) systems more democratic than plurality-based (majoritarian) systems but they are also more effective in terms of macroeconomic performance. This article offers a critical reexamination of these claims. The author provides empirical evidence that the superior performance of consensus democracy on two important macroeconomic indicators-inflation and unemployment-is driven largely by corporatism and central bank independence. After controlling for these, the results indicate that the core elements of consensus democracy are associated with higher rates of both inflation and unemployment. Whereas corporatism and independent central banks are claimed as elements of a broader concept of consensus democracy, the author argues that neither can be comfortably accommodated within the consensus framework depicted by Lijphart.},

Top incomes represent a small share of the population but a very significant share of total income and total taxes paid. Hence, aggregate economic growth per capita and Gini inequality indexes are sensitive to excluding or including top incomes. We discuss the estimation methods and issues that arise when constructing top income share series, including income definition and comparability over time and across countries, tax avoidance, and tax evasion. We provide a summary of the key empirical findings. Most countries experience a dramatic drop in top income shares in the first part of the twentieth century in general due to shocks to top capital incomes during the wars and depression shocks. Top income shares do not recover in the immediate postwar decades. However, over the last thirty years, top income shares have increased substantially in English speaking countries and in India and China but not in continental European countries or Japan. This increase is due in part to an unprecedented surge in top wage incomes. As a result, wage income comprises a larger fraction of top incomes than in the past. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and empirical models that have been proposed to account for the facts and the main questions that remain open. (JEL D31, D63, H26, N30)},

While there are other differences between these countries, this paper explores how variations in the political system per se influence equilibrium redistributive tax rates and income distributions. A three-party proportional representation model is developed in which taxes are determined through legislative bargaining among successful electoral parties, and the economic decision for individuals is occupational choice. Political-economic equilibria for this model and for a two-party, winner-take-all, majoritarian system are derived and compared.}

The development of quantitative imaging methods along with machine learning has enabled the opportunity to move data science research towards translation for more personalized cancer treatments. Accumulating evidence has indeed demonstrated that noninvasive advanced imaging analytics, that is, radiomics, can reveal key components of tumor phenotype for multiple three-dimensional lesions at multiple time points over and beyond the course of treatment. These developments in the use of CT, PET, US, and MR imaging could augment patient stratification and prognostication buttressing emerging targeted therapeutic approaches. In recent years, deep learning architectures have demonstrated their tremendous potential for image segmentation, reconstruction, recognition, and classification. Many powerful open-source and commercial platforms are currently available to embark in new research areas of radiomics. Quantitative imaging research, however, is complex and key statistical principles should be followed to realize its full potential. The field of radiomics, in particular, requires a renewed focus on optimal study design/reporting practices and standardization of image acquisition, feature calculation, and rigorous statistical analysis for the field to move forward. In this article, the role of machine and deep learning as a major computational vehicle for advanced model building of radiomics-based signatures or classifiers, and diverse clinical applications, working principles, research opportunities, and available computational platforms for radiomics will be reviewed with examples drawn primarily from oncology. We also address issues related to common applications in medical physics, such as standardization, feature extraction, model building, and validation.},

Students and scholars in anthropology, sociology, visual studies, and cultural studies will greatly benefit from this pioneering look at the way the visual is inextricably threaded through most, if not all, areas of human activity.},

Given the prevalence of coalition governments in proportional systems, we analyze a type of strategic voting seldom studied: how expected coalition composition affects voter choice. We identify Duvergerian behavior by voters targeted at the coalition formation stage. We contend that when voters perceive their preferred party as unlikely to participate in the coalition, they often desert it and instead support the lesser of evils among those they perceive as viable coalition partners. We demonstrate our argument using data on coalition expectations from the 2006 Israeli elections. We find an appreciable albeit differential effect of coalition expectations on voter choice. Importantly, results hold controlling for ideological and coalition preferences. Lastly, we explore a broad cross-national comparison, showing that there is less, not more, proximity voting where coalitions are prevalent.},

We look at how individual legislators allocate their efforts to serving unorganized constituents versus organized groups. Our model shows how the optimal allocation of effort is affected by differences in nominating processes and electoral rules. Our findings include the following: (1) Closed-list proportional representation (PR) makes legislators generally more responsive to interest groups and less responsive to unorganized voters than single-member districts (SMD). (2) This difference becomes smaller as the personal component of the SMD vote diminishes. (3) Legislators elected via lists in a mixed system may be even less responsive to the unorganized than legislators in a pure list system.},

In theoretischer Hinsicht wird aus Sicht eines werterwartungstheoretischen Erkl\"arungsansatzes angenommen, dass Personen bei Interviews an sozialer Anerkennung und Vermeiden von Missbilligung durch den Interviewer interessiert sind und diejenige Antwortreaktion ausw\"ahlen, um diese Ziele zu optimieren. Wenn f\"ur Befragte die Fragen zum eigenen delinquenten Handeln irrelevant sind oder die SET unverst\"andlich geblieben ist, dann verweigern sie eher die Antworten als Personen, die sowohl die Fragen und die SET verstanden als auch entsprechende Antworten auf Fragen zur eigenen Delinquenz haben. Zum anderen wird davon ausgegangen, dass Interview- und Interviewereffekte auch bei zugesicherter Anonymit\"at zur Antwortverweigerung f\"uhren k\"onnen. Mit Daten des ALLBUS k\"onnen diese Annahmen weitgehend best\"atigt werden. Schlie\ss lich wird gezeigt, dass dieses selektive Antwortverhalten zu verzerrten Sch\"atzergebnissen bei Modellen zu Determinanten des beabsichtigten delinquenten Handelns wie Steuerhinterziehung oder 'Schwarzfahren' f\"uhren kann. Bei heiklen und unangenehmen Fragen zum delinquenten Handeln w\"are die postalische Befragung ein effizienter Ausweg, um dieses methodische Problem zu l\"osen. F\"ur die endg\"ultige Kl\"arung dieser Sachverhalte ben\"otigen wir mehr Informationen \"uber die Mechanismen und Prozesse, die zur Verweigerung von Antworten f\"uhren.' (Autorenreferat)'In the German General Survey 2000 (ALLBUS) the so-called sealed envelope technique was used to collect information about the individuals' self-reported delinquency. The article looks in particular at why respondents refuse to fill out this confidential questionnaire in spite of the guaranteed anonymity. From a theoretical perspective of subjective expected utility, it could be assumed that respondents are interested in maximizing benefits and avoiding social costs in the interview situation. Therefore, they respond to questions in a manner to realise their interests in the optimal way. At the same time, individual respondent characteristics related to their understanding of the questions or the sealed envelope technique, as well as interviewer characteristics and aspects of the interview situation could lead to refusals on sensitive questions. The ALLBUS 2000 data confirm these hypotheses. The selectivity of self-reported delinquency on things such as faredodging and tax evasion also resulted in biased model estimators of determinants of anticipated future delinquency. Mail surveys could be one way to improve data quality in self-reported acts of delinquency. Before firm conclusions can be drawn, however, more empirical data is needed on the processes and mechanisms behind respondents refusing to answer questions about delinquency.' (author's abstract)|},

Duverger's propositions concerning the psychological and mechanical consequences of electoral rules have previously been examined mainly through the lens of district magnitude, comparing the properties of single\textendash member district plurality elections with those of multimember proportional representation elections. The empirical consequences of multimember plurality (MMP) rules, on the other hand, have received scant attention. Theory suggests that the effect of district magnitude on the number and concentration of parties will differ with regard to whether the allocation rules are plurality\textendash based or proportional. I test this theory by drawing on a uniquely large\textendash sample dataset where district magnitude and electoral formula vary but the basic universe of political parties is held constant, applying regression analysis to data from several thousand Hungarian local bodies elected in 1994 consisting of municipal councils, county councils, and mayors. The results indicate that omitting the variable of electoral formula has the potential to cause significant bias in estimates of Duvergerian consequences of district magnitude. In addition, the analysis of multi\textendash member plurality elections from the local election dataset reveals counter\textendash intuitively that candidate and party entry may increase with district magnitude under MMP, suggesting important directions for future investigation of MMP rules.},

Respondents were also asked about their opinion on a number of sensitive topics, such as feelings toward blacks and homosexuals and their opinions about spending on popular programs, including schools and the environment. Their responses to these questions varied as a function of their self-presentation personality characteristics.

My analysis of NES data from 1992 reveals that public opinion polls overstate support for government efforts to integrate schools. Specifically, selection bias models reveal that some individuals who harbor anti-integrationist sentiments are likely to hide their socially unacceptable opinions behind a "don't know" response. As an independent confirmation of the selection bias correction technique, I find that the same methods which predict that opinion polls understate opposition to school integration also predict the results of the 1989 New York City mayoral election more accurately than the marginals of pre-election tracking polls.},

The authors argue that PR has two contradictory consequences. On one hand, PR leads to more parties and more choice for voters; but these parties are less centrist, and this increases the overall distance between voters and parties. On the other hand, PR increases the likelihood of coalition governments; this pulls the government toward the center of the policy spectrum and reduces the distance between the government and voters. These two contradictory effects of PR wash out, and the net overall impact of PR on congruence is nil. The data support the authors' interpretation.},

Due to this inherent heterogeneity, HCC lesions can manifest variable aggressiveness with different response to treatment options, including the newer targeted therapies. Hence, radiomics can be used as a potential tool to enable patient selection for therapies and to predict response to treatments and outcome. Additionally, radiomics may serve as a tool for earlier and more efficient assessment of response to treatment. Radiomics, radiogenomics, and radio-immunoprofiling and their potential roles in management of patients with HCC will be discussed and critically reviewed in this article.},

  abstract = {[This article analyzes the processes of distribution and redistribution in postindustrial democracies. The authors combine a pooled time-series data base on welfare state effort and its determinants assembled by Huber, Ragin, and Stephens (1997) with data on income distribution assembled in the Luxembourg Income Survey (LIS) archive. In the case of the LIS data, the authors recalculate the microdata in order to remove the distorting influence of pensioners on pretax, pretransfer income distribution. They examine the determinants of two dependent variables: pretax, pretransfer income inequality and the proportional reduction in inequality from pre- to post-tax and transfer inequality. They test hypotheses derived from power resources theory against alternatives derived from the literature on the development of the welfare state and the determinants of income inequality. The results offer strong support for power resources theory, particularly in the case of reduction in inequality. Union density, unemployment, and percentage of female-headed households were the main determinants of pre-tax and transfer inequality (\$\{\textbackslash rm R\}\^\{2\}\$ = .64), while leftist government, directly and indirectly through its influence on the size of the welfare state, was found to be by far the strongest determinant of distribution (\$\{\textbackslash rm R\}\^\{2\}\$ = .81).]}

In particular, we show that discretionary spending (public investment) is hit harder by fiscal austerity than entitlement spending (public spending on pensions and unemployment) because of different institutional and political constraints. Second, we find that electoral institutions affect how governments solve this trade-off. Discretionary spending is cut back more severely in countries with an electoral system based on proportional representation than in a majoritarian system. Our empirical analysis relies on a methodological approach (composite data analysis) that takes into account interdependencies between budgetary categories. Using data for 21 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries from 1979 to 2003, we find strong evidence for the varying impact of fiscal stress on the budget shares of discretionary and entitlement spending as well as strong interactive effect between fiscal austerity and electoral institutions.},

  abstract = {This paper examines whether the voter with the median income is decisive in local spending decisions. Previous tests have relied on cross-sectional data while we make use of a pair of California referenda to estimate a first difference specification. The referenda proposed to lower the required vote share for passing local educational bonding initiatives from 67 to 50\% and 67 to 55\%, respectively. We find that voters rationally consider future public service decisions when deciding how to vote on voting rules. However, the empirical evidence strongly suggests that an income percentile below the median is decisive for majority voting rules, especially in communities that have a large share of high-income voters with attributes that suggest low demand for public services. Based on a model that explicitly recognizes that each community contains voters with both high and low demand for public school spending, we also find that an increase in the share of low demand voters is associated with a lower decisive voter income percentile for the high demand group. This two type model implies that our low demand types (individuals over age 45 with no children) have demands that are 45\% lower than other voters. Collectively, these findings are consistent with high-income voters with weak preferences for public educational services voting with the poor against increases in public spending on education.

The proposed image segmentation method is based on the firefly algorithm whose solutions are improved by the k-means clustering algorithm when Otsu's criterion was used as the fitness function. The proposed combined algorithm was tested on commonly used images from Harvard Whole Brain Atlas and the results were compared to other method from literature. The method proposed in this paper achieved better segmentation considering standard segmentation quality metrics such as normalized root square mean error, peak signal to noise and structural similarity index metric.},

The academic literature commonly divides electoral systems into two types, majoritarian and proportional, and implies a straightforward trade-off by which having more of an ideal that a majoritarian system provides means giving up an equal measure of what proportional representation (PR) delivers. We posit that these trade-offs are better characterized as nonlinear and that one can gain most of the advantages attributed to PR, while sacrificing less of those attributed to majoritarian elections, by maintaining district magnitudes in the low to moderate range. We test this intuition against data from 609 elections in 81 countries between 1945 and 2006. Electoral systems that use low-magnitude multimember districts produce disproportionality indices almost on par with those of pure PR systems while limiting party system fragmentation and producing simpler government coalitions.},

  abstract = {The relationship between electoral systems and corruption in a large sample of contemporary democratic nations is analysed in this article. Whereas previous studies have shown that closed-list proportional representation is associated with greater (perceived) corruption than open-list PR, it is demonstrated here that this relationship fails to hold once district magnitude is considered. The theory underlying this study draws on work on 'the personal vote' that suggests that the incentives to amass resources - and perhaps even to do so illegally - increase with district magnitude in open-list settings but decrease in closed-list contexts. Extending this insight, it is shown that political corruption gets more (less) severe as district magnitude increases under open-list PR (closed-list PR) systems. In addition, once district magnitude exceeds a certain threshold - the estimates here are that this is as low as fifteen - corruption is greater under open lists than closed lists. Only at small district magnitudes (below fifteen) is closed-list PR associated with more corruption, as conventionally held. These results hold for alternative measures of corruption, for different sets of countries analysed, for different measures of district magnitude and regardless of whether the political system is presidential or parliamentary, and of the number of parties. Using an objective measure of corruption in public works contracting, corroborating evidence is also presented from Italian electoral districts. In Italy's open-list environment in the period prior to 1994, larger districts were more susceptible to corruption than smaller ones.}

We investigated the impact of surveillance on early detection and survival in a nationally representative database. Methods We included patients with cirrhosis and HCC from the Optum database (2001-2015) with {$>$}6 months of follow-up between cirrhosis and HCC diagnoses. Surveillance adherence was defined as proportion of time covered (PTC), with each 6-month period after abdominal imaging defined as `covered'. To determine the association between surveillance and mortality, we compared PTC between fatal and non-fatal HCC. Results Of 1001 patients with cirrhosis and HCC, 256 died with median follow-up 30 months. Median PTC by any imaging was greater in early-stage vs late-stage HCC (43.6\% vs 37.4\%, P = .003) and non-fatal vs fatal HCC (40.8\% vs 34.3\%, P = .001). In multivariable analyses, each 10\% increase in PTC was associated with increased early HCC detection (OR 1.07, 95\% CI 1.01-1.12) and decreased mortality (HR 0.95; 95\% CI 0.90-1.00). On subgroup analysis, PTC by CT/MRI was associated with early tumour detection and decreased mortality; however, PTC by ultrasound was only associated with early detection but not decreased mortality. These findings were robust across sensitivity analyses. Conclusions In a US cohort of privately insured HCC patients, PTC by any imaging modality was associated with increased early detection and decreased mortality. Continued evaluation of HCC surveillance strategies and effectiveness is warranted.},

However, it is extremely challenging to build a sufficiently large dataset due to difficulty of data acquisition and annotation in 3D medical imaging. We aggregate the dataset from several medical challenges to build 3DSeg-8 dataset with diverse modalities, target organs, and pathologies. To extract general medical three-dimension (3D) features, we design a heterogeneous 3D network called Med3D to co-train multi-domain 3DSeg-8 so as to make a series of pre-trained models. We transfer Med3D pre-trained models to lung segmentation in LIDC dataset, pulmonary nodule classification in LIDC dataset and liver segmentation on LiTS challenge. Experiments show that the Med3D can accelerate the training convergence speed of target 3D medical tasks 2 times compared with model pre-trained on Kinetics dataset, and 10 times compared with training from scratch as well as improve accuracy ranging from 3\% to 20\%. Transferring our Med3D model on state-the-of-art DenseASPP segmentation network, in case of single model, we achieve 94.6\textbackslash\% Dice coefficient which approaches the result of top-ranged algorithms on the LiTS challenge.},

I develop a model of elections under PR, in which voters choose among an arbitrary finite number of parties, and the policy outcome is determined in a postelection bargaining stage. I use a new solution concept, robust equilibrium, which greatly mitigates the well-known problem of indeterminate predictions in multicandidate competition. Applying the equilibrium concept to the model, I find that PR promotes representation of small parties in general, even when voters are strategic. However, the median voter plays a critical role in shaping policy outcomes, which reflects the majoritarian nature of parliamentary policy making rules. Thus, PR may not be incompatible with the majoritarian vision of representative democracy if voters' main concern is policy outcomes.},

This paper presents a method to automatically segment liver and lesions in CT and MRI abdomen images using cascaded fully convolutional neural networks (CFCNs) enabling the segmentation of large-scale medical trials and quantitative image analyses. We train and cascade two FCNs for the combined segmentation of the liver and its lesions. As a first step, we train an FCN to segment the liver as ROI input for a second FCN. The second FCN solely segments lesions within the predicted liver ROIs of step 1. CFCN models were trained on an abdominal CT dataset comprising 100 hepatic tumor volumes. Validation results on further datasets show that CFCN-based semantic liver and lesion segmentation achieves Dice scores over 94\% for the liver with computation times below 100s per volume. We further experimentally demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method on 38 MRI liver tumor volumes and the public 3DIRCAD dataset.},

The network learns from these sparse annotations and provides a dense 3D segmentation. (2) In a fully-automated setup, we assume that a representative, sparsely annotated training set exists. Trained on this data set, the network densely segments new volumetric images. The proposed network extends the previous u-net architecture from Ronneberger et al. by replacing all 2D operations with their 3D counterparts. The implementation performs on-the-fly elastic deformations for efficient data augmentation during training. It is trained end-to-end from scratch, i.e., no pre-trained network is required. We test the performance of the proposed method on a complex, highly variable 3D structure, the Xenopus kidney, and achieve good results for both use cases.},

We shed light on this puzzle by exploiting a novel EU-28 wide survey (Eurobarometer 471) and matching it with an array of regional and national inequality measures. Using binary choice models, we show that support for redistribution is positively linked with the level of income inequality. The same association is found for perceptions of inequality being too high. In addition, we exploit alternative proxies of socio-economic status as well as subjective beliefs about fairness in the society. We document that individuals believing to be at the top of the social ladder, as well as people considering equal opportunities to be in place, are less supportive of gov- ernment intervention to reduce inequalities. Our results are robust to different measures of inequalities, additional controls as well as a cross-validation with a widely recognized survey (ESS). We conclude that for the planning of policies based on social preferences, inequality matters.},

Both effects are statistically significant and approximately equal. However, neither effect is very large in comparison to underlying patterns of politicization, which are argued to be reflections of the number of political cleavages in society. These cleavages predispose each party system to converge toward a country-specific effective number of parties within 5 elections, regardless of the initial level of fragmentation, barring outside disturbances. Major devaluations may act as such disturbances, but the evidence so far is inconclusive. The analysis is based on new data from 62 elections in Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela, supplemented by 30+ additional elections in Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, and Uruguay for the exploration of economic impacts.},

Under these systems, voters choose representatives simultaneously under both propor-tional representation (PR) and single-member district plurality (SMDP) rules. It is widely accepted that SMDP rules tend to winnow competition down toward two large parties, and evi-dence from mixed systems suggests that this Duvergerian ``gravity '' reduces the number of par-ties surviving SMDPcompetition undermixed systems aswell. Nevertheless,we argue, simulta-neous balloting under PR rules softens this winnowing effect, operating as a ``centrifugal force'' that prevents Duvergerian gravity from reducing competition to the degree it does under pure SMDP systems. Thus, these new systems produce effects unanticipated by their designers. To test for the presence of this centrifugal force, we examine elite-level electoral strategies in Ger-many, Japan, and Italy and compare district-level SMDP election results from pure systemswith those of mixed-member systems.},

This book employs a unified game-theoretic model to study strategic coordination worldwide and that relies primarily on constituency-level rather than national aggregate data in testing theoretical propositions about the effects of electoral laws. This book also considers not just what happens when political forces succeed in solving the coordination problems inherent in the electoral system they face but also what happens when they fail.},

The results proved here provide some formal underpinning for this idea and yield specific hypotheses, for each electoral system, concerning the maximum number of lists/candidates consistent with equilibrium levels of strategic voting. Our results also clarify the conditions under which these theoretical upper bounds on the number of lists/candidates are binding in practice.

This article draws on unique data that allow unprecedented insight into the attitudinal profile of ERP voters in Britain \textendash{} an often neglected case in the wider literature. A series of possible motivational drivers of extreme right support are separated out: racial prejudice, anti-immigrant sentiment, protest against political elites, Euroscepticism, homophobia and Islamophobia. It is found that BNP support in the 2009 EP elections was motivationally diverse, with racist hostility, xenophobia and protest voting all contributing significantly to BNP voting. The analysis suggests that the BNP, which has long been a party stigmatised by associations with racism and violent extremism, made a key breakthrough in 2009. While racist motivations remain the strongest driver of support for the party, it has also begun to win over a broader coalition of anti-immigrant and anti-elite voters.},

  abstract = {The Gini coefficient is a downward-biased measure of inequality in small populations when income is generated by one of three common distributions. The paper discusses the sources of bias and argues that this property is far more general. This has implications for (i) the comparison of inequality among subsamples, some of which may be small, and (ii) the use of the Gini in measuring firm size inequality in markets with a small number of firms. The small-sample bias has often led to misperceptions about trends in industry concentration. A small-sample adjustment results in a reduced bias, which can no longer be signed. This remaining bias rises with the dispersion and falls with increasing skewness of the distribution. Finally, an empirical example illustrates the importance of using the adjusted Gini. In this example it is shown that, controlling for market characteristics, larger shipping cartels include a set of firms that is stochastically identical (in terms of relative size) to those of smaller shipping cartels.},

Inequality in disposable income and earnings net of taxes and transfers also increased, but much less than the increased inequality in pre-government earnings. These different developments are most likely explained by the generous Swedish welfare system. Consistent with these observations, we see no clear trend in consumption inequality. We also estimate stochastic processes for household earnings. A simple random-walk process captures much of the life-cycle dynamics. But we find clear evidence that the true earnings process is not a random walk. We demonstrate that some estimation methods result in severe upward bias in the estimated volatility of permanent shocks if serial correlation in temporary shocks is ignored. Our estimation results show that the increase in earnings inequality is almost entirely driven by an increase in residual earnings inequality. Moreover, this increase was mostly generated by an increased volatility of persistent shocks.},

Globalization even increased implicit tax rates on capital (as calculated by [Carey, D., Rabesona, J., 2002. Tax ratios on labour and capital income and on consumption.

However, there seems to be competition over tax rates on capital when data based on legislation (as suggested by [Devereux, M.P., Griffith, R., 2003. Evaluating tax policy for location decisions.

Regions that traditionally have lower incidence of HCC, such as North America and certain areas of Europe, have seen increased incidence, and regions that are traditionally high risk, such as Japan and China, have shown declining rates. This observation is likely due to changes in exposure to HCC risk factors, including chronic hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus infection, heavy alcohol consumption, diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Cirrhosis is by and large the most significant risk factor and the foundation for most HCC surveillance programs. When looking at the contribution of risk factors on HCC burden, people must consider the population-attributable fraction, a combination measure of the prevalence of a condition and the risk estimate.},

  abstract = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and resulting nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are highly prevalent in the United States, where they are a growing cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and increasingly an indicator for liver transplantation. A Markov model was used to forecast NAFLD disease progression. Incidence of NAFLD was based on historical and projected changes in adult prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Assumptions were derived from published literature where available and validated using national surveillance data for incidence of NAFLD-related HCC. Projected changes in NAFLD-related cirrhosis, advanced liver disease, and liver-related mortality were quantified through 2030. Prevalent NAFLD cases are forecasted to increase 21\%, from 83.1 million (2015) to 100.9 million (2030), while prevalent NASH cases will increase 63\% from 16.52 million to 27.00 million cases. Overall NAFLD prevalence among the adult population (aged {$\geq$}15 years) is projected at 33.5\% in 2030, and the median age of the NAFLD population will increase from 50 to 55 years during 2015-2030. In 2015, approximately 20\% of NAFLD cases were classified as NASH, increasing to 27\% by 2030, a reflection of both disease progression and an aging population. Incidence of decompensated cirrhosis will increase 168\% to 105,430 cases by 2030, while incidence of HCC will increase by 137\% to 12,240 cases. Liver deaths will increase 178\% to an estimated 78,300 deaths in 2030. During 2015-2030, there are projected to be nearly 800,000 excess liver deaths. Conclusion: With continued high rates of adult obesity and DM along with an aging population, NAFLD-related liver disease and mortality will increase in the United States. Strategies to slow the growth of NAFLD cases and therapeutic options are necessary to mitigate disease burden. (Hepatology 2018;67:123-133).},

In a country-year prospective longitudinal analysis of EFC prediction, higher GDP-percapita (per GDP-per-capita doubling, relative risk [RR] = 1.77, 95\% CI: 1.49-2.10), higher primary school completion (per +20\% completion, RR = 2.30, 1.65-3.21), and higher adult literacy were significantly associated with achieving EFC. Results also identify a GDP-percapita of I\$5000 as a minimum level for development of EFC. GDP-per-capita and education were each robust predictors in middle-income countries, and education remained significant even controlling for time-varying GDP growth. For income-inequality, the GINI coefficient was suggestive in its role in predicting EFC (p = 0.024). For social and political indicators, a greater degree of ethnic fractionalization (per +25\%, RR= 0.51, 0.38-0.70), proportional electoral system (RR= 2.80, 1.22-6.40), and dictatorships (RR= 0.10, 0.05-0.27) were further associated with EFC. The novel EFC index and this longitudinal prospective study together indicate that investment in both economic growth and education should be seen of equal importance for development of UHC. Our findings help in understanding the social and political drivers of universal healthcare, especially for transitioning countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The present study compared the performance of four methods: Brain Extraction Tool (BET; Smith [2002]: Hum Brain Mapp 17:143\textendash 155); 3dIntracranial (Ward [1999] Milwaukee: Biophysics Research Institute, Medical College of Wisconsin; in AFNI); a Hybrid Watershed algorithm (HWA, Segonne et al.

[2001] Neuroimage 13:856\textendash 876) to manually stripped images. The methods were applied to uncorrected and bias-corrected datasets; Legacy and Contemporary T1-weighted image sets; and four diagnostic groups (depressed, Alzheimer's, young and elderly control). To provide a criterion for outcome assessment, two experts manually stripped six sagittal sections for each dataset in locations where brain and nonbrain tissue are difficult to distinguish. Methods were compared on Jaccard similarity coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Methods tended to perform better on contemporary datasets; bias correction did not significantly improve method performance. Mesial sections were most difficult for all methods. Although AD image sets were most difficult to strip, HWA and BSE were more robust across diagnostic groups compared with 3dIntracranial and BET. With respect to specificity, BSE tended to perform best across all groups, whereas HWA was more sensitive than other methods. The results of this study may direct users towards a method appropriate to their T1-weighted datasets and improve the efficiency of processing for large, multisite neuroimaging studies. Hum.

These databases differ considerably in purpose, coverage, data sources, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and quality of documentation. This special issue reviews and compares eight such databases. Five are microdata-based: CEPALSTAT, Income Distribution Database (IDD), LIS, PovcalNet, and Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean (SEDLAC); two are based on secondary sources: "All the Ginis" (ATG) and the World Income Inequality Database (WIID); and one is generated entirely through multiple-imputation methods: the Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID). Although there is much agreement across these databases, there is also a non-trivial share of country/year cells for which substantial discrepancies exist. In some cases, different databases would lead users to radically different conclusions about inequality dynamics in certain countries and periods. The methodological differences that lead to these discrepancies often appear to be driven by a fundamental trade-off between a wish for broader coverage on the one hand, and for greater comparability on the other. These differences across databases place considerable responsibility on both producers and users: on the former, to better document and explain their assumptions and procedures, and on the latter, to understand the data they are using, rather than merely taking it as true because available.},

The conceptual territory of democratic representational regimes can be mapped out in four theoretical patterns of state-society relations: adversarial, delegative, deliberative, and cooptive. A comparison of representational regimes in state-society relations in Argentina and Brazil shows a shift in civil society towards organization in nongovernmental organizations, in addition to social movements. Despite this common characteristic, the different emerging representational regimes in these two countries carry different implications for the quality of democracy.}

However, recently declassified US documents and interviews with key actors reveal a different story. International sanctions for human right violations were affecting both countries' leverage in the international community and creating internal political problems. This finding suggests that both countries were keen to use mediation as a strategy to remove human rights violations from the US agenda.},

Studies have shown that dispositional factors, such as social identity and personality traits, affect ethnocentric reactions and that attitudes differ between social categories. However, broader national and international explanations have been neglected in the literature. This book fills this major gap by providing a unique account of the relationship between nationalist attitudes and the exclusion of migrants across a range of European countries, the US, Canada and Australia. Drawing on a variety of comparative surveys, the authors assess whether ethnic exclusionist reactions and nationalist attitudes are indeed systematically related across countries, and whether variations in such attitudes reflect country-level as well as individual-level differences. The authors consider the multidimensionality of the concepts of nationalism and exclusionism as well as the empirical associations, and analyze the attitudes of both majority and minority groups within the countries studied.},

The party's endorsements of equal rights, fair housing laws and school busing have cost it the support of some whites, but these losses have been concentrated at the periphery of the party, among those least committed to its guiding principles or most unsympathetic to its efforts on behalf of racial equality. We argue that with the rise of affirmative action as the primary vehicle to advance racial equality, racial politics have become divisive in a new way, and that opposition to affirmative action now encompasses whites within the liberal core of the Democratic party. Contrasting traditional survey measures of affirmative action attitudes with an experimentally-based, unobtrusive measure of opposition to affirmative action, we show that racially liberal whites are reluctant to admit their anger over racial preferences when confronted with traditional survey questions in a telephone interview. When measured with an unobtrusive instrument, however, white opposition to affirmative action is found to be just as strong among liberals as conservatives, among Democrats as Republicans, and among those most committed to racial harmony and equality as among those least committed to such values. We argue that whites' anger over affirmative action stems less from a lack of concern with racial equality than from a commitment to individual achievement and self-reliance. Thus, while core constituents of the Democratic party are more opposed to affirmative action than has previously been recognized, the Democrats can draw strength from the enduring commitment of many whites to the goal of racial equality.}

As we demonstrate, empirical results regarding ideological congruence can depend on exactly how scholars conceptualize and measure it. In addition to clarifying various aspects of how scholars currently conceptualize congruence, we introduce a new conceptualization and measure of congruence that captures a long tradition in democratic theory emphasizing the ideal of having a legislature that accurately reflects the preferences of the citizenry as a whole. Our new measure is the direct counterpart for congruence of the vote-seat disproportionality measures so heavily used in comparative studies of representation. Using particularly appropriate data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, we find that governments in proportional democracies are not substantively more congruent than those in majoritarian democracies. Proportional democracies are, however, characterized by more representative legislatures.},

Data obtained from the European Social Survey (for twenty-one countries) reveal that objection to the admission of foreigners to the country is more pronounced than objection to the allocation of `equal rights'. The data further suggest that objection to admission can be directed either at all non-nationals or only at ethnic and racial minorities. `Total exclusionists' (i.e. support exclusion of all nonnationals) are more likely to support the denial of foreigners from equal rights than `racial exclusionists' (i.e. support only exclusion of ethnic minorities). Multi-level analyses show that support for exclusion is also influenced by socio-economic characteristics of individuals (e.g. education, political orientation) and characteristics of their countries (e.g. size of the non-European population). The findings are discussed in light of sociological theory.},

  abstract = {Background \& Aims Biannual ultrasound has poor sensitivity for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) screening. MRI is accurate for the detection of HCC, but a complete MRI is not feasible as a screening tool. Abbreviated MRI (AMRI) is an acceptable alternative. The diagnostic performance of different AMRI protocols is not known. We performed a systematic review to determine the diagnostic accuracy of AMRI for HCC screening. Methods We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for studies reporting the diagnostic accuracy of AMRI for HCC screening. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of different AMRI protocols were calculated based on a random intercept logistic regression model. The diagnostic performance of AMRI was compared with ultrasound. Study quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Results Of the 11,327 studies screened by titles, 15 studies (3 prospective and 12 retrospective: 2,807 patients, 917 with HCC) were included in the final analysis. The pooled per-patient sensitivity and specificity were 86\% (95\% CI 84\textendash 88\%, I2 0\%) and 94\% (95\% CI 91\textendash 96\%, I2 83\%), respectively. Pooled per-lesion sensitivity was 77\% (95\% CI 74\textendash 81\%, I2 8\%). There was no influence of study type, screening setting, reference standard, and presence and etiology of cirrhosis on the performance of AMRI. The sensitivity of AMRI for detection of HCC {$<$}2~cm was lower than that for HCC {$\geq$}2~cm (69\% vs. 86\%). The sensitivity and specificity of non-contrast AMRI were comparable to contrast-enhanced AMRI (86\% and 94\% vs. 87\% and 94\%, respectively). The diagnostic performance of different non-contrast AMRI and contrast-enhanced AMRI protocols was comparable. The sensitivity of ultrasound was lower than AMRI (53\% vs. 82\%). Conclusions AMRI has high sensitivity and specificity for HCC screening. Different AMRI protocols have comparable diagnostic performance. Lay summary Abbreviated MRI (AMRI) has been suggested as an alternative to ultrasound and complete MRI for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) screening. Our study results showed that AMRI has a high per-patient and per-lesion sensitivity for HCC. Although the sensitivity of AMRI for detection of HCC {$<$}2~cm is considerably lower than for HCC {$\geq$}2~cm, it is substantially higher than ultrasound, making it a potential alternative for HCC screening in high-risk populations.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate a proof-of-concept convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning system (DLS) that classifies common hepatic lesions on multi-phasic MRI. METHODS: A custom CNN was engineered by iteratively optimizing the network architecture and training cases, finally consisting of three convolutional layers with associated rectified linear units, two maximum pooling layers, and two fully connected layers. Four hundred ninety-four hepatic lesions with typical imaging features from six categories were utilized, divided into training (n\,=\,434) and test (n\,=\,60) sets. Established augmentation techniques were used to generate 43,400 training samples. An Adam optimizer was used for training. Monte Carlo cross-validation was performed. After model engineering was finalized, classification accuracy for the final CNN was compared with two board-certified radiologists on an identical unseen test set. RESULTS: The DLS demonstrated a 92\% accuracy, a 92\% sensitivity (Sn), and a 98\% specificity (Sp). Test set performance in a single run of random unseen cases showed an average 90\% Sn and 98\% Sp. The average Sn/Sp on these same cases for radiologists was 82.5\%/96.5\%. Results showed a 90\% Sn for classifying hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to 60\%/70\% for radiologists. For HCC classification, the true positive and false positive rates were 93.5\% and 1.6\%, respectively, with a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.992. Computation time per lesion was 5.6~ms. CONCLUSION: This preliminary deep learning study demonstrated feasibility for classifying lesions with typical imaging features from six common hepatic lesion types, motivating future studies with larger multi-institutional datasets and more complex imaging appearances. KEY POINTS: \textbullet{} Deep learning demonstrates high performance in the classification of liver lesions on volumetric multi-phasic MRI, showing~potential as an eventual decision-support tool for radiologists. \textbullet{} Demonstrating a classification runtime of a few milliseconds per lesion, a deep learning system could be incorporated into the clinical workflow in a time-efficient manner.},

Computational ``radiomic'' techniques extract biomarker information from images which can be used to improve diagnosis and predict tumour biology. Aims To perform a systematic review on radiomic features in HCC diagnosis and prognosis, with a focus on reporting metrics and methodologic standardisation. Methods We performed a systematic review of all full-text articles published from inception through December 1, 2019. Standardised data extraction and quality assessment metrics were applied to all studies. Results A total of 54 studies were included for analysis. Radiomic features demonstrated good discriminatory performance to differentiate HCC from other solid lesions (c-statistics 0.66-0.95), and to predict microvascular invasion (c-statistic 0.76-0.92), early recurrence after hepatectomy (c-statistics 0.71-0.86), and prognosis after locoregional or systemic therapies (c-statistics 0.74-0.81). Common stratifying features for diagnostic and prognostic radiomic tools included analyses of imaging skewness, analysis of the peritumoural region, and feature extraction from the arterial imaging phase. The overall quality of the included studies was low, with common deficiencies in both internal and external validation, standardised imaging segmentation, and lack of comparison to a gold standard. Conclusions Quantitative image analysis demonstrates promise as a non-invasive biomarker to improve HCC diagnosis and management. However, standardisation of protocols and outcome measurement, sharing of algorithms and analytic methods, and external validation are necessary prior to widespread application of radiomics to HCC diagnosis and prognosis in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset.

Ethnographic Film (1976) was one of the first books to provide a comprehensive introduction to this field of visual anthropology, and it quickly became the standard reference.In this new edition, Karl G. Heider thoroughly updates Ethnographic Film to reflect developments in the field over the three decades since its publication, focusing on the work of four seminal filmmakers\textemdash Jean Rouch, John Marshall, Robert Gardner, and Timothy Asch. He begins with an introduction to ethnographic film and a history of the medium. He then considers many attributes of ethnographic film, including the crucial need to present "whole acts," "whole bodies," "whole interactions," and "whole people" to preserve the integrity of the cultural context. Heider also discusses numerous aspects of making ethnographic films, from ethics and finances to technical considerations such as film versus video and preserving the filmed record. He concludes with a look at using ethnographic film in teaching.},

Theoretical accounts of this empirical regularity are generally tested using macro-level data, leaving micro-level implications untested. In this paper, I take an alternative approach, leveraging the fact that the theories in question make predictions about the electoral coordination between parties and voters around broad-based redistribution under alternative institutional arrangements. To test the theories, I create a novel measure of income-based voting, which captures the sensitivity of vote choice to changes in income and forms the dependent variable in a second stage model. Overall, I find robust support for more proportionality leading to more income-based voting. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Existing research on this question is inconclusive, at least in part because it is difficult with observational data to isolate the effect of district magnitude on voting behavior independently from voters' preferences or the number of parties. Hence, we investigate this issue in a laboratory experiment, where we vary district magnitude while keeping the distribution of voters' preferences and the number of parties constant. We find that voting for the preferred party (sincere voting) increases with district magnitude. This is consistent with existing findings from observational data. We also discover a surprising result: a high incidence of ``frontrunner'' voting, which cannot be easily explained by existing research.},

The results indicate that Driscoll\textendash Kraay standard errors are well calibrated when cross-sectional dependence is present.

Using a dataset covering 89 developed and developing democracies, I find that inequality is associated with more redistribution. Second, I show that inequality's effect on redistribution is weaker in democracies in which the poor \textendash{} defined as the people with income below the median \textendash{} are divided along ethnic lines than in those in which they are ethnically unified.

In the Proportionate Influence vision, election outcomes result in legislatures that reflect the preferences of all citizens; legislative bargaining results in policies linked to the position of the median voter. The authors give more explicit theoretical form to those visions and link them empirically to specific types of modern democracies. They then attempt to test the success of each vision in bringing about congruence between citizen self-placements and the estimated positions of governments and policymaker coalitions on the left-right scale in twelve nations in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Although the analysis reveals weaknesses in each approach, it suggests a consistent advantage for the Proportionate Influence vision.},

Other investigators have argued that education increases commitment to democratic norms, but only at a superficial level. We review the arguments from that debate and then subject them to empirical test with national survey data on the intergroup beliefs, feelings, predispositions for personal contact, and policy orientations of men toward women, of whites toward blacks, and of the nonpoor toward the poor. The results of that comprehensive analysis fail to support the view either that education produces liberation from intergroup negativism or that it produces a superficial democratic commitment. With that ascertained, we depart from the confines of past debate and propose a fresh approach that rests on different assumptions about the nature of both intergroup attitudes and educational institutions. We argue that dominant social groups routinely develop ideologies that legitimize and justify the status quo, and the well-educated members of these dominant groups are the most sophisticated practitioners of their group's ideology. We interpret our data from this perspective and suggest that the well educated are but one step ahead of their peers in developing a defense of their interests that rests on qualification, individualism, obfuscation, and symbolic concessions.}

We tackle head-on problems related to model specification that risk generating large biases in estimates because of mechanical associations between the dependent and explanatory variables. The results suggest that the bias in the earlier work can be substantial. The descriptive analysis highlights, in addition, how scarce the data are when it comes to information about the extent of redistribution in developing countries.},

Restrictionist sentiments are found to be more widespread among the U.S. populace than previous studies have estimated, especially among college graduates and political liberals. Conclusion. My findings have implications for immigration scholars and social scientists who study other sensitive attitudes and behaviors.

We use household-level data from the Luxembourg Income Study to calculate an alternative measure of government redistribution that includes public-sector pensions in ``pregovernment'' income alongside private-sector pensions, on the assumption that each represents a claim on future income. Results. Employing the alternative method described in the article results in lower values for redistribution than the conventional measure. Conclusion. We suggest that our alternative method be used in addition to the conventional method in cross-national research, in an effort to achieve a more complete understanding of government redistribution in the developed countries.},

The presence of these non-brain tissues is considered as a major obstacle for automatic brain image segmentation and analysis techniques.

We suggest that contextual influences may affect                     the socially desirable bias, leading to variance in the rate of overreporting                     across countries. This leads us to hypothesize that nonvoters will be more                     likely to overreport voting in elections that have high turnout. We rely on                     validated turnout data to measure overreporting in five countries which vary a                     great deal in turnout: Britain, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the United                     States.

Key indicators of the quality of a measuring instrument are the reliability and validity of the measures. The process of developing and validating an instrument is in large part focused on reducing error in the measurement process. Reliability estimates evaluate the stability of measures, internal consistency of measurement instruments, and interrater reliability of instrument scores. Validity is the extent to which the interpretations of the results of a test are warranted, which depends on the particular use the test is intended to serve. The responsiveness of the measure to change is of interest in many of the applications in health care where improvement in outcomes as a result of treatment is a primary goal of research. Several issues may affect the accuracy of data collected, such as those related to self-report and secondary data sources. Self-report of patients or subjects is required for many of the measurements conducted in health care, but self-reports of behavior are particularly subject to problems with social desirability biases. Data that were originally gathered for a different purpose are often used to answer a research question, which can affect the applicability to the study at hand. Conclusion. In health care and social science research, many of the variables of interest and outcomes that are important are abstract concepts known as theoretical constructs. Using tests or instruments that are valid and reliable to measure such constructs is a crucial component of research quality.},

  abstract = {Attempts to measure and analyze public opinion attitudes toward racial/ethnic minorities often confront the ``social desirability'' problem: those who have prejudiced attitudes are rarely willing to admit them to surveyors. Instead, they may be more likely to give a socially acceptable answer rather an accurate reflection of their views. Previous research has clearly established that this effect presents a challenge for accurately measuring self-reported racial and policy attitudes that primarily affect African\textendash Americans. It is less clear, however, how it might affect self-reported responses to attitudes dealing with Latinos and immigration. This study thus seeks to analyze the extent to which social desirability may affect survey measures of perceived levels of cultural threat (nativism). Results from two separate analyses using the Crowne\textendash Marlowe ``social desirability scale'' and a survey ``list experiment'' demonstrate that social desirability is indeed a concern for accurately measuring nativism in the American public, but that it exerts an opposite effect from what has previously been observed: nativist attitudes tend to be over-reported in opinion surveys.},

  abstract = {Radiomics is a relatively new word for the field of radiology, meaning the extraction of a high number of quantitative features from medical images. Artificial intelligence (AI) is broadly a set of advanced computational algorithms that basically learn the patterns in the data provided to make predictions on unseen data sets. Radiomics can be coupled with AI because of its better capability of handling a massive amount of data compared with the traditional statistical methods. Together, the primary purpose of these fields is to extract and analyze as much and meaningful hidden quantitative data as possible to be used in decision support. Nowadays, both radiomics and AI have been getting attention for their remarkable success in various radiological tasks, which has been met with anxiety by most of the radiologists due to the fear of replacement by intelligent machines. Considering ever-developing advances in computational power and availability of large data sets, the marriage of humans and machines in future clinical practice seems inevitable. Therefore, regardless of their feelings, the radiologists should be familiar with these concepts. Our goal in this paper was three-fold: first, to familiarize radiologists with the radiomics and AI; second, to encourage the radiologists to get involved in these ever-developing fields; and, third, to provide a set of recommendations for good practice in design and assessment of future works.},

My paper also argues that she might conceive an interaction between them when she offers a theatrical model of contemporary political action, relaxing the distinction which otherwise remains rigid through most of her work. This paper tries to show that civil disobedience presumes the sympathetic gaze of spectator because its actor requests the distinctively moral perspective of non-active audience in a theatrical setting of the public realm.},

After a review of the main patterns of white and African-American public opinion on this topic, three central theoretical interpretations of racial policy attitudes\textemdash new racism, politics and nonracial principles and values, and group conflict theories\textemdash are described and compared. The empirical evidence for each approach is assessed. Finally, directions of research that pursue a more complex view of racial policy attitudes are introduced. These include efforts to incorporate insights across theoretical domains as well as correcting an overemphasis on cognitive issues to the exclusion of affect. In addition, gaps in our understanding of ``non-white'' attitudes, nonprejudiced respondents, nonracial policies, and non-Americans are identified as potentially fertile ground for future research aimed at understanding the complexity of racial policy attitudes and what these can reveal about contemporary US race relations.},

A frequent explanation is that the normative climate presently salient in the semipublic setting of a survey interview creates social desirability pressures, resulting in an overstatement of liberal racial attitudes, especially by more educated respondents. Using a tripartite survey-based experiment, I compare answers to racial attitude questions under three conditions of privacy: a standard survey condition where interviewers asked all questions; a modified face-to-face condition where respondents answered a subset of racial questions in a self-administered from; and a completely noninterviewer condition where questionnaires were mailed to and returned by respondents. Three hypotheses are investigated: (1) white respondents will express less liberal racial attitudes as privacy increases; (2)privacy effects are greatest for questions about the principles of racial equality and other traditional racial attitudes and least for questions about racial policies and symbolic racism; and (3) privacy effects are stronger among the highly educated, who are more aware of current norms and thus feel social desirability pressures with greater force. Results offer some support for the social desirability hypothesis, especially among more educated respondents. However, contrary to expectations, the effects occur more consistently for racial policies than traditional racial attitudes. Instead of treating privacy effects as "errors" in a simple sense, I draw on supplementary qualitative interviews to connect the survey results to the larger normative change in whiteracial attitudes. Other complicating factors, such as acquiescent tendencies among less educated respondents, are also considered.}

We review the emerging data on the risk and determinants of HCC in these conditions and the implications of HCC surveillance. However, from a public health perspective, active hepatitis C and B continue to drive most of the global burden of HCC. In United States, the age-adjusted incidence rates of HCC in Hispanics have surpassed those of HCC in Asians. Prognosis in HCC is complex because of the competing risk imposed by underlying cirrhosis and presence of malignancy. In addition to tumor burden, liver function and performance status; additional parameters including tumor biopsy, serum markers, and subclassification of current staging systems; and taking into account patterns of tumor progression may improve patient selection for therapy. Advancements in the treatment of HCC have included identification of patients who are most likely to derive a clinically significant benefit from the available therapeutic options. Additionally, the combination strategies of locoregional therapies and/or systemic therapy are being investigated.},

Here we present novel evidence on the nature of educational differences in anti-Black attitudes among Whites. We replicate the education effect on explicit self-report measures of anti-Black attitudes, but we find that education is much less related to implicit measures of anti-Black attitudes. Implicit measures differ from explicit measures in that they do not allow respondents to control the measurement outcome; they therefore measure more spontaneous aspects of attitudes. These results shed new light on intergroup attitudes of the higher educated. Higher educated people are more likely to be aversive racists, that is, to score low on explicit, but not implicit measures of prejudice. Given the differential relation of explicit versus implicit measures to behavior, they have wide-ranging implications for the kind of intergroup behavior and discrimination we can expect from less and more highly educated people.},

Terry Eagleton suggests of Dickens, that his `grotesque realism is a stylistic distortion in the service of truth, a kind of astigmatism which allows us to see more accurately.'

The richness, uniqueness and intricacy of               The Wire               has made it difficult to trace its thematic and stylistic heritage. The programme has been referred to as a `lyrical sociology', `a type of urban sociology', `a rendering of urban theory', a `fontless social science', a `theoretical archetype', a `Dickensian show', and more. At an aesthetic level,               The Wire               has been qualified as a work of `psychological realism', `social realism', as something aspiring to Fredric Jameson's aesthetics of `cognitive mapping', or even a `rich counterpart to actor-network-theory'.},

The combination of radiomics data and clinical/laboratory information provides added value in many studies. Radiomics is a multi-step process that requires optimization and standardization, the development of semi-automated or automated segmentation methods, robust data quality control, and refinement of algorithms and modeling approaches for high-throughput data analysis. While radiomics remains largely in the research setting, the strong associations of predictive models and nomograms with certain pathologic, molecular, and immune markers with tumor aggressiveness and patient outcomes, provide great potential for clinical applications to inform optimized treatment strategies and patient prognosis.},

Using a series of multivariate regression analyses and controlling for genre, critical appraisal, arthouse label, being a sequel, and including a popular star, films with a female presence earn less at the box office. This effect, however, appears to be largely the consequence of movies that feature women having smaller production budgets, suggesting that the underrepresentation of women in film stems from ``upstream'' routines of film industry gatekeepers, not a lesser interest in stories about women in the minds of the public.},

Problems arise when one tries to be exact: how large must a party be for the single-member district system to be its most favorable choice? Will any party find a particular magnitude most preferable? This article extends existing theories of effective thresholds and proposes a seat\textendash vote equation different from the cube law. With reasonable assumptions, I demonstrate that a certain district magnitude maximizes the expected seat share of a particular median-sized party in elections using the d'Hondt PR or SNTV formulae. The validity of this threshold model is verified by an empirical study on recent elections in Finland and Taiwan.},

Progress in computational methods, especially in artificial intelligence for medical image process and analysis, has converted these images into quantitative and minable data associated with clinical events in oncology management. This concept was first described as radiomics in 2012. Since then, computer scientists, radiologists, and oncologists have gravitated towards this new tool and exploited advanced methodologies to mine the information behind medical images. On the basis of a great quantity of radiographic images and novel computational technologies, researchers developed and validated radiomic models that may improve the accuracy of diagnoses and therapy response assessments. Here, we review the recent methodological developments in radiomics, including data acquisition, tumor segmentation, feature extraction, and modelling, as well as the rapidly developing deep learning technology. Moreover, we outline the main applications of radiomics in diagnosis, treatment planning and evaluations in the field of oncology with the aim of developing quantitative and personalized medicine. Finally, we discuss the challenges in the field of radiomics and the scope and clinical applicability of these methods.},

A systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic performance of gadoxetic acid disodium (Gd-EOB-DTPA)\textendash enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) was performed in diagnosing small HCCs measuring up to 2 cm ({$\leq$}2 cm). Two investigators searched multiple databases for studies in which the performances of either Gd-EOB-DTPA\textendash enhanced MRI or MDCT were reported with sufficient data to construct 2 \texttimes{} 2 contingency tables for diagnosing HCCs up to 2 cm on a per-lesion or per-patient level. Diagnostic performances were quantitatively pooled by a bivariate random-effect model with further meta-regression and subgroup analyses. A total of 27 studies (14 on Gd-EOB-DTPA\textendash enhanced MRI, 9 on MDCT, and 4 on both) were included, enrolling a total of 1735 patients on Gd-EOB-DTPA\textendash enhanced MRI and 1781 patients on MDCT. Gd-EOB-DTPA\textendash enhanced MRI demonstrated significantly higher overall sensitivity than did MDCT (0.96 versus 0.65; P {$<$} 0.01), without substantial loss of specificity (0.94 versus 0.98; P {$>$} 0.05). Area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.97 with Gd-EOB-DTPA\textendash enhanced MRI and 0.85 with MDCT. Regarding Gd-EOB-DTPA\textendash enhanced MRI, sensitivity was significantly higher for studies from non-Asian countries than Asian countries (0.96 versus 0.93; P {$<$} 0.01), for retrospective studies than prospective studies (0.95 versus 0.91; P {$<$} 0.01), and for those with Gd-EOB-DTPA injection rate {$\geq$} 1.5 mL/s than that of {$<$}1.5 mL/s (0.97 versus 0.90; P {$<$} 0.01). In conclusion, Gd-EOB-DTPA\textendash enhanced MRI demonstrated higher sensitivity and overall diagnostic accuracy than MDCT, and thus should be the preferred imaging modality for diagnosing small HCCs measuring up to 2 cm.

While numerous papers have tested this proposition, the literature has remained divided over the appropriate measure for redistribution. Revisiting the original contribution by Meltzer and Richard in 1981, the present paper argues that the median voter hypothesis implies that relative redistribution should increase in line with inequality. However, an empirical test based on 110 observations from the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) finds no support for the hypothesis. By contrast, voters' actual preferences offer a better guide to understanding redistributive outcomes. The findings challenge the narrow concept of human motivation that underpins rational choice, and point to the importance of fairness orientations that have been emphasized in behavioral economics.},

We test this proposition with data from 15 to 18 advanced democracies and find that both redistribution and nonelderly social spending increase as the dispersion of earnings in the upper half of the distribution increases relative to the dispersion of earnings in the lower half of the distribution. In addition, we present survey evidence on preferences for redistribution among middle-income voters that is consistent with our theory and regression results indicating that left parties are more likely to participate in government when the structure of inequality is characterized by skew.},

  abstract = {Once upon a time ethnographers returning from the field simply sat down, shuffled their note cards, and wrote up their descriptions of the exotic and quaint customs they had observed. Today scholars in all disciplines are realizing how their research is presented is at least as important as what is presented. Questions of voice, style, and audience--the classic issues of rhetoric--have come to the forefront in academic circles. John Van Maanen, an experienced ethnographer of modern organizational structures, is one who believes that the real work begins when he returns to his office with cartons of notes and tapes. In Tales of the Field he offers readers a survey of the narrative conventions associated with writing about culture and an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of various styles. He introduces first the matter-of-fact, realistic report of classical ethnography, then the self-absorbed confessional tale of the participant-observer, and finally the dramatic vignette of the new impressionistic style. He also considers, more briefly, literary tales, jointly told tales, and the theoretically focused formal and critical tales. Van Maanen illustrates his discussion of each style with excerpts from his own work on the police. Tales of the Field offers an informal, readable, and lighthearted treatment of the rhetorical devices used to present the results of fieldwork. Though Van Maanen argues ultimately for the validity of revealing the self while representing a culture, he is sensitive to the differing methods and aims of sociology and anthropology. His goal is not to establish one true way to write ethnography, but rather to make ethnographers of all varieties examine their assumptions about what constitutes a truthful cultural portrait and select consciously and carefully the voice most appropriate for their tales. Written with grace and humor, Tales of the Field will be an invaluable introduction to novices just learning the fieldwork trade and provocative stimulant to veteran ethnographers.

  abstract = {This article offers an empirical assessment of a number of aspects of the reduction of market income inequality as a result of government taxes and transfers, and of the distributive effect of wage-bargaining institutions and minimum wages, in thirteen developed countries over the last twenty five years. It considers five broad themes in the literature: the median voter approach, which argues that government redistribution is associated with inequality of pre-government income; the power resources approach, which emphasizes partisan political contestation and electoral participation; the institutional approach, which focuses on political institutions such as the electoral system; the labor organization approach, which argues that labor unions play a key role in government efforts to achieve a more egalitarian distribution of market income; and the economic globalization approach, which argues that integration into the global economy has undermined public social protection efforts. The article finds consistent positive relationships between direct government redistribution and four variables: the extent of pre-government inequality; the level of electoral turnout; the share of the labor force that is unionized; and the presence of proportional representation electoral systems. As to wage-bargaining institutions, the article confirms that there is a positive relationship between the degree of coordination of wage bargaining and a relatively egalitarian distribution of earnings across various income groups, and (more weakly) between the level of statutory minimum wages in a country and the earnings share of the lowest-income group.

Why exactly welfare states fit into this three-regime typology remains controversial, however. This article presents an argument which provides the three-regime heuristic with a historical foundation. The argument combines insights into the importance of electoral rules for the representation of socioeconomic interests (of the lower and middle classes) with insights about the different cleavage structures which left their imprint on the party systems of Western Europe. This article's central claim is that a majoritarian electoral system leads to a residual-liberal welfare state, whereas in countries with proportional representation, either a red-green coalition between Social Democracy and agrarian parties (Scandinavia) or a red-black coalition between Social Democracy and Christian Democracy (on the European continent) was responsible for the build-up of the Nordic and continental welfare state, respectively.},

Power generated in spaces of appearance depends on and reproduces horizontal relationships of equality, whereas power in spaces of surveillance depends on and reproduces vertical relationships of inequality.

  abstract = {In a general equilibrium model of a labor economy, the size of government, measured by the share of income redistributed, is determined by majority rule. Voters rationally anticipate the disincentive effects of taxation on the labor-leisure choices of their fellow citizens and take the effect into account when voting. The share of earned income redistributed depends on the voting rule and on the distribution of productivity in the economy. Under majority rule, the equilibrium tax share balances the budget and pays for the voters' choices. The principal reasons for increased size of government implied by the model are extensions of the franchise that change the position of the decisive voter in the income distribution and changes in relative productivity. An increase in mean income relative to the income of the decisive voter increases the size of government.}

  abstract = {The median-voter hypothesis has been central to an extensive literature on consequences of income redistribution. For example, it has been proposed that greater inequality is associated with lower growth, because of the greater redistribution that is sought by the median voter when income distribution is less equal. There have however been no proper tests of the median-voter hypothesis concerning redistribution, because of previous absence of data on factor-income distribution (that is, incomes before taxes and transfers) across households, and thus on the gains by poorer households from redistribution. The study reported in this paper is based on the required data, with 79 observations drawn from household budget surveys from 24 democracies. The results strongly support the conclusion that countries with greater inequality of factor income redistribute more to the poor. This is so even when we control for the share of the elderly in the population and for pension transfers. The evidence that the median-voter hypothesis adequately describes the collective-choice mechanism is however considerably weaker. Although middle-income groups gain more/or lose less through redistribution in countries where initial (factor) income distribution is more unequal, this regularity is all but lost when, by excluding pensions, we look only at explicit redistributive social transfers from which middle classes contemporaneously gain little. This leaves us searching for an alternative explanation: do middle-classes gain from transfers in the long run even if not contemporaneously?; or is the median-voter hypothesis, based on direct democracy, a proper representation of the mechanisms of collective decision making in representative democracy?},

While spending is targeted toward some "swing" districts, we do also find it is higher in districts represented by members of the government party, especially those in the federal Cabinet, and those of lower seniority. We develop a model featuring bargaining over legislative and non-legislative favours that is consistent with the evidence.},

Radiomics is characterized by the extraction of several quantitative imaging features which are not visible to the naked eye from conventional imaging modalities, and its correlation with specific relevant clinical endpoints, such as pathology, therapeutic response, and survival. Several studies have evaluated the use of radiomics in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with encouraging results, particularly in the pretreatment prediction of tumor biological characteristics, risk of recurrence, and survival. In spite of this, there are limitations and challenges to be overcome before the implementation of radiomics into clinical routine. In this article, we will review the concepts of radiomics and their current potential applications in patients with HCC. It is important that the multidisciplinary team involved in the treatment of patients with HCC be aware of the basic principles, benefits, and limitations of radiomics in order to achieve a balanced interpretation of the results toward a personalized medicine.},

Most studies view the distributional process in two phases with inequality shaped first by markets and then by state redistribution. Typically, cross-national analyses of inequality limit the influence of politics to the redistributive phase. But we argue that a full understanding of how government affects inequality must also consider how politics shapes the market. While redistribution is undoubtedly an important mechanism employed by government to influence distributional outcomes, we find that inequality produced by the market is more responsive to politics than is redistribution. Left partisan power and public investment in human capital significantly reduce inequality in the market phase. In addition, social spending on human capital conditions the effect of economic growth. As human capital investment increases, growth becomes more equality enhancing, providing further evidence of the market conditioning effect of policy.},

  abstract = {Objective Employing transfer learning (TL) with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), well-trained on non-medical ImageNet dataset, has shown promising results for medical image analysis in recent years. We aimed to conduct a scoping review to identify these studies and summarize their characteristics in terms of the problem description, input, methodology, and outcome. Materials and methods To identify relevant studies, MEDLINE, IEEE, and ACM digital library were searched for studies published between June 1st, 2012 and January 2nd, 2020. Two investigators independently reviewed articles to determine eligibility and to extract data according to a study protocol defined a priori. Results After screening of 8421 articles, 102 met the inclusion criteria. Of 22 anatomical areas, eye (18\%), breast (14\%), and brain (12\%) were the most commonly studied. Data augmentation was performed in 72\% of fine-tuning TL studies versus 15\% of the feature-extracting TL studies. Inception models were the most commonly used in breast related studies (50\%), while VGGNet was the common in eye (44\%), skin (50\%) and tooth (57\%) studies. AlexNet for brain (42\%) and DenseNet for lung studies (38\%) were the most frequently used models. Inception models were the most frequently used for studies that analyzed ultrasound (55\%), endoscopy (57\%), and skeletal system X-rays (57\%). VGGNet was the most common for fundus (42\%) and optical coherence tomography images (50\%). AlexNet was the most frequent model for brain MRIs (36\%) and breast X-Rays (50\%). 35\% of the studies compared their model with other well-trained CNN models and 33\% of them provided visualization for interpretation. Discussion This study identified the most prevalent tracks of implementation in the literature for data preparation, methodology selection and output evaluation for various medical image analysis tasks. Also, we identified several critical research gaps existing in the TL studies on medical image analysis. The findings of this scoping review can be used in future TL studies to guide the selection of appropriate research approaches, as well as identify research gaps and opportunities for innovation.},

The goal is to develop practical guidelines that will enable researchers to select the best estimator for a given type of data. It extends a previous study on the subject (Reed and Ye, Which panel data estimator should I use? 2011), and modifies their recommendations. The new recommendations provide a (virtually) complete decision tree: When it comes to choosing an estimator for efficiency, it uses the size of the panel dataset (N and T) to guide the researcher to the best estimator. When it comes to choosing an estimator for hypothesis testing, it identifies one estimator as superior across all the data scenarios included in the study. An unusual finding is that researchers should use different estimators for estimating coefficients and testing hypotheses. The authors present evidence that bootstrapping allows one to use the same estimator for both.},

This attitude is in contrast to fairer-skinned migrants from within and outside the continent who are believed to be higher up the hierarchy of ``purity'' of humanity often expressed in terms of belonging to racial, cultural, geographical, class, gender, and generational categories (Gupta \& Ferguson 1992; Stolcke 1995; Geschiere 2009).},

However, even if we restrict our attention to Eastern Europe or the successor states of the Soviet empire, we encounter a range of social diversity--ethnic heterogeneity--that is as great as those in the set of countries examined in earlier studies that seek to identify the influence of electoral laws (see Rae, Lijphart, and Taagepera and Shugart). Curiously, though, these earlier studies fail to ascertain whether and to what extent electoral laws mediate the influence of this heterogeneity. Hence, to develop a more pragmatic understanding of electoral institutions, we adopt the view of electoral laws as intervening structures, and using the data of these earlier analyses, we reconsider the role of one institutional parameter--district magnitude--that some researchers regard as the most important characteristic of an electoral system. Aside from the usual caveats about the limitations of our data, our primary conclusion is that district magnitude is not merely an important determinant of the number of parties that compete in a political system, but that it can offset the tendency of parties to multiply in heterogeneous societies.},

The latter is supposed to yield more honest answers to sensitive questions by experimentally offering the interviewee a higher degree of confidentiality. Under direct questioning conditions, we replicated the education effect; 75\% of the highly educated expressed xenophile attitudes, as opposed to only 55\% of the less educated. Under randomized-response conditions, we obtained significantly reduced estimates of 53\% for the proportion of xenophiles among the highly educated, and 24\% among the less educated, indicating a strong distortion of self-reported attitudes towards foreigners in both groups. However, a significant proportion of participants disobeyed the RRT instructions regardless of education. Because the education effect was found even after controlling for social desirability, it seems to be a genuine effect, rather than an artefact of a differential response bias.

  abstract = {In the quantitative assessment of Diabetic maculopathy from Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SDOCT) images, analysis of intraretinal fluid filled regions plays a vital role because of its comparative superiority in providing tissue-level anatomical information. The detailed study on efficacy and performance of soft computing techniques-based automatic detection and diagnosis for SDOCT retinal images is still in the preliminary stage. Although some automatic algorithms have been proposed to segment retinal layers in recent times, full accuracy in edge detection continues to be a challenging problem. Some researchers have developed different versions of automatic algorithms for segmenting intraretinal fluid based on region-based level-set method and the retinal layers by dual gradient method. This particular level-set implementation is carried out using a fast front propagation algorithm. A valid search region is then defined to identify layer boundaries. The features of the segmented region are analyzed volumetrically and based on these temporal characteristics, the severity of the disease can then be estimated. Some operational algorithms have also been developed for registration of Peripapillary OCT and fundus image for the identification of Neovascularization in the early stage of diabetic proliferative retinopathy. This chapter offers the reader a comprehensive review of the soft computing techniques applied to SDOCT retinal image analysis, particularly for image segmentation and registration techniques.},

  abstract = {This volume invites the reader to join in with the recent focus on subjectivity and self-reflection, as the means of understanding and engaging with the social and historical changes in the world through storytelling. It examines the symbiosis between anthropology and fiction, on the one hand, by looking at various ways in which the two fields co-emerge in a fruitful manner, and, on the other, by re-examining their political, aesthetic, and social relevance to world history. Following the intellectual crisis of the 1970s, anthropology has been criticized for losing its ethnographic authority and vocation. However, as a consequence of this, ethnographic scope has opened towards more subjective and self-reflexive forms of knowledge and representations, such as the crossing of the boundaries between autobiography and ethnography. The collection of essays re-introduces the importance of authorship in relationship to readership, making a ground-breaking move towards the study of fictional texts and images as cultural, sociological, and political reflections of the time and place in which they were produced. In this way, the contributors here contribute to the widening of the ethnographic scope of contemporary anthropology. A number of the chapters were presented as papers in two conferences organised by the Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, entitled ``Arts and aesthetics in a globalising world'' (2012), and at the University of Exeter, entitled ``Symbiotic Anthropologies'' (2015). Each chapter offers a unique method of working in the grey area between and beyond the categories of fiction and non-fiction, while creatively reflecting upon current methodological, ethical, and theoretical issues, in anthropology and cultural studies. This is an important book for undergraduate and post-graduate students of anthropology, cultural and media studies, art theory, and creative writing, as well as academic researchers in these fields.},

  abstract = {Over the last decade there has been an extensive evolution in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field. Modern radiation oncology is based on the exploitation of advanced computational methods aiming to personalization and high diagnostic and therapeutic precision. The quantity of the available imaging data and the increased developments of Machine Learning (ML), particularly Deep Learning (DL), triggered the research on uncovering ``hidden'' biomarkers and quantitative features from anatomical and functional medical images. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have achieved outstanding performance and broad implementation in image processing tasks. Lately, DNNs have been considered for radiomics and their potentials for explainable AI (XAI) may help classification and prediction in clinical practice. However, most of them are using limited datasets and lack generalized applicability. In this study we review the basics of radiomics feature extraction, DNNs in image analysis, and major interpretability methods that help enable explainable AI. Furthermore, we discuss the crucial requirement of multicenter recruitment of large datasets, increasing the biomarkers variability, so as to establish the potential clinical value of radiomics and the development of robust explainable AI models.},

In addition, GRD partially mediates the effects of such distal predictors of prejudice as education and family income. Finally, blaming the victim mediates in part the GRD link with prejudice.

Striking similarities emerge in the findings across structural, demographic, contact, economic, political, personality, and threat predictors. Opposition to immigration is routinely found strongest among the older and less-educated segments of the population who live in areas with anti-immigration norms and little contact with immigrants. Anti-immigration attitudes also correlate with political conservatism and alienation, economic deprivation, and especially with authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, and perceived collective threat.},

This article takes a different perspective by looking at the effect of the electoral formula, district magnitude and ballot structure on how important the constituency is for MPs in three countries that differ on these three components of the electoral system: Belgium, France and Portugal. And the results, though they should be confirmed by analyses on more countries, provide interesting insights. In particular they show that the difference in nature between single and multi-member districts is more important for constituency-orientation than differences between multi-member districts. Second, the article shows that the effect of electoral institutions is not straightforward: its impact is stronger on attitudes towards the constituency than on actaul behaviours of legislators regarding their constituency.},

I argue that anthropologists have moved away from a concern with representation per se in favor of the more complex discursive and political landscapes opened up by the concepts of media and the archive. My review of this work focuses on the affective register of suspicion that has surrounded both visual methods and the idea of race in anthropology. Whereas this suspicion has led some to dismiss visual technologies as inherently racializing or objectifying, I argue that it is possible to reclaim suspicion as a productive site for rethinking the particular forms of presence, uncertainty, and contingency that characterize both ethnographic and visual accounts of the world. I begin by discussing recent work on the photographic archive, early fieldwork photography, and the subsequent move in the 1960s and 1970s from still photography to film and video within the emergent subfield of visual anthropology. Finally, I consider how more recent work on the problem of race in favor of descriptive accounts of mediascapes.}

  abstract = {The first collection of critical essays on HBO's The Wire - the most brilliant and socially relevant television series in years The Wire is about survival, about the strategies adopted by those living and working in the inner cities of America. It presents a world where for many even hope isn't an option, where life operates as day-to-day existence without education, without job security, and without social structures. This is a world that is only grey, an exacting autopsy of a side of American life that has never seen the inside of a Starbucks.Over its five season, sixty-episode run (2002-2008), The Wire presented several overlapping narrative threads, all set in the city of Baltimore. The series consistently deconstructed the conventional narratives of law, order, and disorder, offering a view of America that has never before been admitted to the public discourse of the televisual. It was bleak and at times excruciating. Even when the show made metatextual reference to its own world as Dickensian, it was too gentle by half.By focusing on four main topics (Crime, Law Enforcement, America, and Television), The Wire: Urban Decay and American Television examines the series' place within popular culture and its representation of the realities of inner city life, social institutions, and politics in contemporary American society. This is a brilliant collection of essays on a show that has taken the art of television drama to new heights.},

However, there are fundamental differences in data sizes, features and task specifications between natural image classification and the target medical tasks, and there is little understanding of the effects of transfer. In this paper, we explore properties of transfer learning for medical imaging. A performance evaluation on two large scale medical imaging tasks shows that surprisingly, transfer offers little benefit to performance, and simple, lightweight models can perform comparably to ImageNet architectures. Investigating the learned representations and features, we find that some of the differences from transfer learning are due to the over-parametrization of standard models rather than sophisticated feature reuse. We isolate where useful feature reuse occurs, and outline the implications for more efficient model exploration. We also explore feature independent benefits of transfer arising from weight scalings.},

Reliabilities (alpha) of .16, .21, and .36 were reported for 10-, 10-, and 20-item forms of the scale. Such reliabilities make any scale unusable. O'Gorman's data, however, may have been atypical. Although the army conscripts should have formed a sample far more representative in intellectual, educational, and socioeconomic terms than the usual ``sample'' of college students, this advantage may have been outweighed by atypical social desirability responding due to the peculiar institutional position of the Ss. This suspicion is supported by the fact that the alpha for the full 33-item Marlowe-Crowne scale in O'Gorman's data was only .46. Data from less coerced general population Ss might yield quite different results. Such data are reported below.},

The authors examine policy and emotional underpinnings of these responses, finding that expressed emotions of anxiety and enthusiasm condition latent racial attitudes and racial policy beliefs especially for those exhibiting a social desirability bias. The results suggest that Obama's victory despite this level of concern about race was at least in part a result of intense enthusiasm his campaign generated. This enthusiasm for Obama may have allowed some white voters to overcome latent concerns about his race. The research suggests emotions are critical in understanding racial attitudes.},

Estimator performance is compared on two dimensions: (i) root mean square error and (ii) accuracy of estimated confidence intervals. An innovation of our study is that our simulated panel data sets are designed to look like `real-world' panel data. We find large differences in the performances of the respective estimators. Further, estimators that perform well on efficiency grounds may perform poorly when estimating confidence intervals and vice versa. Our experimental results form the basis for a set of estimator recommendations. These are applied to `out of sample' simulated panel data sets and found to perform well.},

Each step needs careful evaluation for the construction of robust and reliable models to be transferred into clinical practice for the purposes of prognosis, non-invasive disease tracking, and evaluation of disease response to treatment. After the definition of texture parameters (shape features; first-, second-, and higher-order features), we briefly discuss the origin of the term radiomics and the methods for selecting the parameters useful for a radiomic approach, including cluster analysis, principal component analysis, random forest, neural network, linear/logistic regression, and other. Reproducibility and clinical value of parameters should be firstly tested with internal cross-validation and then validated on independent external cohorts. This article summarises the major issues regarding this multi-step process, focussing in particular on challenges of the extraction of radiomic features from data sets provided by computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.},

To determine if there is a relative diagnostic benefit of one over the other, we synthesized evidence regarding the relative performance of CT, extracellular contrast\textendash enhanced MRI, and gadoxetate-enhanced MRI for diagnosis of HCC in patients with cirrhosis. We also assessed whether liver biopsy versus follow-up with the same versus alternative imaging is best for CT-indeterminate or MRI-indeterminate liver nodules in patients with cirrhosis. We searched multiple databases from inception to April 27, 2016, for studies comparing CT with extracellular contrast\textendash enhanced MRI or gadoxetate-enhanced MRI in adults with cirrhosis and suspected HCC. Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data. Of 33 included studies, 19 were comprehensive, while 14 reported sensitivity only. For all tumor sizes, the 19 comprehensive comparisons showed significantly higher sensitivity (0.82 versus 0.66) and lower negative likelihood ratio (0.20 versus 0.37) for MRI over CT. The specificities of MRI versus CT (0.91 versus 0.92) and the positive likelihood ratios (8.8 versus 8.1) were not different. All three modalities performed better for HCCs {$\geq$}2 cm. Performance was poor for HCCs {$<$}1 cm. No studies examined whether adults with cirrhosis and an indeterminate nodule are best evaluated using biopsy, repeated imaging, or alternative imaging. Concerns about publication bias, inconsistent study results, increased risk of bias, and clinical factors precluded support for exclusive use of either gadoxetate-enhanced or extracellular contrast\textendash enhanced MRI over CT. Conclusion: CT, extracellular contrast\textendash enhanced MRI, or gadoxetate-enhanced MRI could not be definitively preferred for HCC diagnosis in patients with cirrhosis; in patients with cirrhosis and an indeterminate mass, there were insufficient data comparing biopsy to repeat cross-sectional imaging or alternative imaging.

They have used the median voter framework extensively, both in theoretical work and in empirical analysis. This paper reviews the empirical work, concluding that the studies fail to indicate that actual expenditures correspond in general to those desired by the median voter. The economic studies fail to identify whether expenditures are at the level desired by the median voter or at some multiple of this level. They also fail to identify whether the median voter is pivotal or a voter at some other fractile is pivotal. Moreover, the basic median voter model is rarely tested against competing theoretical or statistical models. In some studies parameter estimates are not consistent with the theoretical model designed on the basis of the median voter hypothesis. The economic studies suggest that expenditures depend not only on the preferences of voters but also on the structure of political institutions. The presence of bureaucratic threats is offered as an institutional setting that can result in expenditures significantly in excess of those desired by the median voter.},

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.},

  abstract = {The skull stripping method is an important area of study in brain image processing applications. It acts as preliminary step in numerous medical applications as it increases speed and accuracy of diagnosis in manifold. It removes non-cerebral tissues like skull, scalp, and dura from brain images. In this regard, a simple skull stripping algorithm, termed as S3, is proposed in this paper, which is based on brain anatomy and image intensity characteristics. The proposed S3 method is unsupervised and knowledge based. It uses adaptive intensity thresholding followed by morphological operations, for increased robustness, on brain magnetic resonance (MR) images. The threshold value is adaptively calculated based on the knowledge of intensity distribution in brain MR images. Experimental results, both qualitative and quantitative, are reported on a set of synthetic and real brain MR T1-weighted images. The performance of the proposed S3 algorithm is compared with that of three popular methods, namely, brain extraction tool (BET), brain surface extractor (BSE), and robust brain extraction (ROBEX) using standard validity indices.},

Namely, that countries with a high degree of market income inequality redistribute little, which is in disagreement with the median voter theorem. In a first step, this paper outlines several mechanisms that explain why government corruption might be partially responsible for this `paradox'. In a second step, different corruption perception indices and an instrumental variable approach are used to provide empirical evidence that indicates a significant negative impact of corruption on redistribution levels for a sample of 148 developing and developed countries. This finding suggests that, next to political and need factors, government corruption explains to some extent the `paradox of redistribution'. This is especially true for many developing countries, given that they typically have relatively high degrees of corruption and low levels of redistribution.},

Using high quality data, it is possible to directly observe individual net cash transfers in several countries and to investigate the effects of taxes and transfers on different social classes and in aggregate. This allows testing of both the ``redistribution hypothesis'' (more inequality leads to more redistribution in aggregate) and the ``median voter hypothesis'' (the middle class plays a special role in policy making). Results suggest acceptance of the former and reject on, or at least questioning, of the latter. Not only the gains from redistribution are negligible for the middle class, but also the link between income and redistribution is also lower for it than for any other class of income. Moreover, the strength of the median voter seems to fall over time. Finally, the amount of redistribution targeted to the middle class is lower in more asymmetric societies, a result that contrasts strongly with the median voter theorem.},

Our goal is to understand why, if inheritance taxes are often very old taxes, the implementation of inheritance tax rates significant enough to affect wealth inequality is a much more recent phenomenon. We hypothesize alternatively that significant taxation of inherited wealth depended on (1) the extension of the suffrage and (2) political conditions created by mass mobilization for war. Using a difference-in-differences framework for identification, we find little evidence for the suffrage hypothesis but very strong evidence for the mass mobilization hypothesis. Our study has implications for understanding the evolution of wealth inequality and the political conditions under which countries are likely to implement policies that significantly redistribute wealth and income.},

In the view of many electoral reformers, mixed-member systems offer the best of both the traditional British single-seat district system and PR systems. This book seeks to evaluate: why mixed-member systems have recently appealed to many countries with diverse electoral histories; and how well expectations for these systems have been met. Each major country, which has adopted a mixed system thus, has two chapters in this book, one on origins and one on consequences. These countries are Germany, New Zealand, Italy, Israel, Japan, Venezuela, Bolivia, Mexico, Hungary, and Russia. In addition, there are also chapters on the prospects for a mixed-member system being adopted in Britain and Canada, respectively. The material presented suggests that mixed-member systems have been largely successful thus far. They appear to be more likely than most other electoral systems to generate two-bloc party systems, without in the process reducing minor parties to insignificance. In addition, they are more likely than any other class of electoral system to simultaneously generate local accountability as well as a nationally-oriented party system. Mixed-member electoral systems have now joined majoritarian and proportional systems as basic options which must be considered whenever electoral systems are designed or redesigned. Such a development represents a fundamental change in thinking about electoral systems around the world.},

However, in Venezuela an experimental `control' is provided by the requirement that voters simultaneously cast a vote for the same party in each of three legislative tiers (Senate, Chamber of Deputies, and State Assembly), each with a different district magnitude. Hence the psychological effect can exert itself on only one tier. In the other tiers exceptionally high or low deviations from proportional representation are observed. The separate effects of district magnitude are analysed by their consequences on the number of electoral parties and the deviation from proportional representation.},

The authors provide a practical approach for successfully implementing a radiomic workflow from planning and conceptualization through manuscript writing. Applications in oncology typically are either classification tasks that involve computing the probability of a sample belonging to a category, such as benign versus malignant, or prediction of clinical events with a time-to-event analysis, such as overall survival. The radiomic workflow is multidisciplinary, involving radiologists and data and imaging scientists, and follows a stepwise process involving tumor segmentation, image preprocessing, feature extraction, model development, and validation. Images are curated and processed before segmentation, which can be performed on tumors, tumor subregions, or peritumoral zones. Extracted features typically describe the distribution of signal intensities and spatial relationship of pixels within a region of interest. To improve model performance and reduce overfitting, redundant and nonreproducible features are removed. Validation is essential to estimate model performance in new data and can be performed iteratively on samples of the dataset (cross-validation) or on a separate hold-out dataset by using internal or external data. A variety of noncommercial and commercial radiomic software applications can be used. Guidelines and artificial intelligence checklists are useful when planning and writing up radiomic studies. Although interest in the field continues to grow, radiologists should be familiar with potential pitfalls to ensure that meaningful conclusions can be drawn.

Previous research has suggested that vote overreporting derives from the respondent's wish to appear to engage in socially desirable behavior. This earlier research suggests that the only respondent characteristic that is strongly related to overreporting is race; measures of socioeconomic status and of general political attitudes are said to be at most weakly related to the tendency to exaggerate voting. These earlier conclusions are incorrect. We measure the extent of overreporting for the population "at risk" of overreporting voting: those who did not actually vote. Respondents most inclined to overreport their voting are those who are highly educated, those most supportive of the regime norm of voting, and those to whom the norm of voting is most salient--the same characteristics that are related to the probability that a person actually votes. Blacks are only slightly more likely to overreport voting than whites. The pattern of relations between education and vote overreporting is opposite what would be found if those who falsely reported voting fit the typical image of the uneducated, uninvolved, "acquiescent" respondent who is concerned primarily with pleasing the interviewer.}

We propose that the reallocation of seats at the district level in PR systems (which hold geographic boundaries constant) provide better leverage to test how the electoral system affects the party system because these reforms are not politically manipulated in the way that national-level reforms are. We look at the effect of changing district magnitude on the effective number of parties winning seats, the number of parties running for office, and the effective number of parties winning votes in 20 countries. Adding seats increases the number of parties that run for office, the number of parties who win votes, and the number of parties who win seats in the subsequent election. The effects on electoral fragmentation is especially large in ethnically and politically divided countries. While the mechanical effect of adding seats is larger than is the psychological effects on parties or voters, these data provide strong evidence that electoral system reforms directly affect election outcomes.},

Since 2008, the StandardizedWorld Income Inequality Database (SWIID) has provided income inequality data that seek to maximize comparability while providing the broadest possible coverage of countries and years. This article describes the current SWIID's construction, highlighting differences from its original version, and reevaluates the SWIID's utility to cross-national income inequality research in light of recently available alternatives. Methods. Coverage of inequality data sets is assessed across country-years; comparability is evaluated in terms of success in predicting the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS), recognized in the field as the gold standard in comparability, before those data are released. Results. The SWIID offers coverage double that of the next largest income inequality data set, and its record of comparability is three to eight times better than those of alternate data sets. Conclusions. As its coverage and comparability far exceed those of the alternatives, the SWIID remains better suited for broadly cross-national research on income inequality than other available sources.},

The goal of the Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID) is to overcome these limitations. A custom missing-data algorithm was used to standardize the U.N. University's World Income Inequality Database; data collected by the Luxembourg Income Study served as the standard. The SWIID provides comparable Gini indices of gross and net income inequality for 153 countries for as many years as possible from 1960 to the present, along with estimates of uncertainty in these statistics. By maximizing comparability for the largest possible sample of countries and years, the SWIID is better suited to broad cross-national research on income inequality than previously available sources.},

  abstract = {In this paper, I will analyze the metamorphosis of penal policy during the process of democratization of the last three decades in Argentina. The beginning of the transition was characterized by an elitist, formalist, and expert-driven mode of penal policy-making that produced several initiatives towards penal moderation. In this context, a certain contraction of punitiveness was produced. This pattern changed in the 1990s. In the context of the extreme neoliberal reforms, some initiatives had emerged oriented towards the increase of penal severity and extension, in an ambivalent landscape. But in the second half of this decade, penal populism emerged from above as a reaction of the elites that changed radically the mode of penal policy-making and fueled a great growth of punitiveness. After the crisis of 2001, there was a new wave of penal populism from below supported by strong social mobilizations around the figure of the victim. This radical mutation of the mode and orientation of penal policy-making generated an image of an epochal change that seemed to set up a new relationship between penalty and democracy. However, in the mid-2000s some symptoms of blockage of penal populism started to appear, creating tensions and contradictions still present today.},

  abstract = {Background \& Aims Chronic liver (CLD) is a major public health concern. We assessed its effects on quality of life and work productivity, as well as its economic burden in the United States. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study of data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS; 2004\textendash 2013). We extracted participants' sociodemographic parameters and medical histories. Subjects with CLD were identified based on Clinical Classification Software codes.~MEPS participants were compared between those with and without CLD, and then between employed and unemployed patients with CLD. Outcomes were quality-of-life scores, employment, and health care use. Results We collected data from 230,406 adult participants (age, {$\geq$}18 y) in the MEPS; 1846 had current CLD (36.7\% with viral hepatitis and 5.3\% with liver cancer). Individuals with CLD were less likely to be employed (44.7\% vs 69.6\% patients without CLD), were not working owing to illness/disability (30.5\% vs 6.6\% without CLD), lost more work because of disability (10.2 vs 3.4 d without CLD), and had more health care use, producing greater health care expenses (\$19,390 vs \$5567/y without CLD) (all P {$<$} .0001). Patients with CLD also had more comorbidities and worse self-reported general and mental health status, and reported more health-related limitations in their daily activities than individuals without CLD (all P {$<$} .0001). They also indicated more psychologic distress and depressive symptoms and had a lower quality of~life and health utility scores (P {$<$} .0001). In multivariate analysis, after adjustment for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities, the presence of CLD was an important predictor of unemployment (odds ratio, 0.60; 95\% confidence interval, 0.50\textendash 0.70), annual health care expenditure ({$\beta$} = \$9503 {$\pm$} \$2028), and impairment in all aspects of health-related quality of life (all P {$<$} .0001). In patients with CLD, the presence of liver cancer had the most profound impact on health care expenditures ({$\beta~$}= \$17,278 {$\pm$} \$5726/y) and physical health ({$\beta~$}= -7.2 {$\pm$} 1.7 for SF-12 physical component) (all P {$<$} .005). Conclusions In a cross-sectional analysis of MEPS participants, we associated CLD with large economic and quality-of-life burdens.},

  abstract = {Empirical evidence suggests that the respondents' approval motive, their desirability beliefs and the privacy of the response situation affects respondents' susceptibility to social desirability bias. Previous research has analyzed the explanatory power of these factors separately and has not taken their possible interdependence as determinants for social desirability bias into account. This article tests the prediction from rational-choice theory that a strong approval motive, clear differences in the perceived desirability of response options and a lack of privacy are all necessary but not sufficient conditions for social desirability bias. According to the empirical results from our first study a three-way interaction between the analyzed factors predicts respondents' racial attitude reports. However, since attitude answers and desirability beliefs were collected in the same interview, the observed associations may be an artifact due to subjects' sensitization for social desirability concerns. This possibility is tested in a second study, where only racial attitude answers were collected under conditions of varying response privacy. Aggregated response differences between the utilized attitude items and respondents' social group affiliation were matched with equivalent differences in the desirability beliefs found in the first study. The results from the main study were replicated with this independent sample of respondents.},

After 40 years, however, it is questionable whether the M-C SDS is still up-to-date. It may well be that one could find new items with a higher degree of social desirability. Four studies are described in which a new scale in the style of the Marlowe-Crowne scale, the Social Desirability Scale-17 (SDS-17), was developed and examined. The SDS-17, a 17-item scale, displayed satisfactory reliability and convergent validity: Internal consistency ranged from .72 to .75; test-retest stability across four weeks was .82; and the correlations with the M-C SDS ranged from .67 to .74. Overall, the SDS-17 is comparable to the M-C SDS. However, it is shorter (17 instead of 23 items) and demonstrates greater face-validity: A sample of 49 judges rated the items of both scales with respect to social desirability. The SDS-17 items received significantly and substantially higher ratings than the M-C SDS items.},

  abstract = {One of the most common MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) use is a brain visualisation. Brain anatomy is highly complicated therefore it might be difficult to extract only these structures which have diagnostic value. In a consequence it is so necessary to develop and apply most efficient brain's segmentation algorithms. One of the first steps in case of neurological MRI analysis is skull stripping. It involves removing extra-meningeal tissue from the head image, therefore it is essential to find the best method to determine the brain and skull boundaries. In T1-weighted images, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space and skull are dark, that is why the edges between the brain and the skull are well-marked but even strong edges might be unsettled because of finite resolution during MRI acquisition or the presence of other anatomical partial structures within the brain (connections between the brain and optic nerves or brainstem). There are many ways to perform this operation, none of them is not so great as to constitute a standard proceedings. In many cases, there are limitations associated with the development environment, license and images input that hinder skull stripping without specialised software. Proposed method is free of these constraints. It is based on application of morphological operations and image filtration to enhance the result of the edge detection and to provide better tissues separation. The efficiency was compared with other methods, common in commercial use, and the results of this comparison was presented in this paper.},

  abstract = {Tax systems raise large amounts of revenue for funding public sector's activities, and tax/transfer policy, together with public provision of education, health care, and social services, play a crucial role in treating the symptoms and the causes of poverty. The normative analysis is crucial for tax/transfer design because it makes it possible to assess separately how changes in the redistributive criterion of the government, and changes in the size of the behavioural responses to taxes and transfers, affect the optimal tax/transfer system. Optimal tax theory provides a way of thinking rigorously about these trade-offs. Written primarily for graduate students and researchers, this volume is intended as a textbook and research monograph, connecting optimal tax theory to tax policy. It comments on some policy recommendations of the Mirrlees Review, and builds on the authors work on public economics, optimal tax theory, behavioural public economics, and income inequality. The book explains in depth the Mirrlees model and presents various extensions of it. The first set of extensions considers changing the preferences for consumption and work: behavioural-economic modifications (such as positional externalities, prospect theory, paternalism, myopic behaviour and habit formation) but also heterogeneous work preferences (besides differences in earnings ability). The second set of modifications concerns the objective of the government. The book explains the differences in optimal redistributive tax systems when governments - instead of maximising social welfare - minimise poverty or maximise social welfare based on rank order or charitable conservatism social welfare functions. The third set of extensions considers extending the Mirrlees income tax framework to allow for differential commodity taxes, capital income taxation, public goods provision, public provision of private goods, and taxation commodities that generate externalities. The fourth set of extensions considers incorporating a number of important real-word extensions such as tagging of tax schedules to certain groups of tax payers. In all extensions, the book illustrates the main mechanisms using advanced numerical simulations.},

These scales also serve to identify individuals at risk for psychological and health problems. The present review explores the evidence with regard to the ability of these scales to achieve these objectives. In the first part of the review, I present six criteria to evaluate impression management scales and conclude that they are unsatisfactory as measures of response style. Next, I explore what individual differences in impression management scores actually do measure. I compare two approaches: a defensiveness approach, which argues that these scales measure defensiveness that stems from vulnerable self-esteem, and an adjustment approach, which suggests that impression management is associated with personal well-being and interpersonal adjustment. Data from a wide variety of fields including social behavior, affect and well-being, health, and job performance tend to favor the adjustment approach. Finally, I argue that scales measuring impression management should be redefined as measures of interpersonally oriented self-control that identify individuals who demonstrate high levels of self-control, especially in social contexts.},

Reliability is demonstrated across three indices of ethnic attitudes in seven representative samples drawn from four European countries (West Germany, Netherlands, France, Great Britain; total N=3788). The hypothesis that this correlation reflects only the tendency of more highly educated respondents to give more socially desirable answers and not true attitude differences was inconsistent with the finding from the survey data that educational level also correlated negatively with responses to an index of subtle prejudice. Results from an experiment employing the bogus pipeline procedure similarly refute this hypothesis, indicating that significant education-related differences in expressed prejudice remain under conditions in which the tendency to give socially desirable responses is reduced. Finally, path analysis based on the survey data show that part but not all of the association between low education and ethnic prejudice is mediated by social psychological variables, particularly group relative deprivation, perceived belief incongruency, political conservatism, and acceptance of inter-ethnic contact.},

This review aims to assess whether radiomics is a useful and reproducible method for clinical management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by reviewing the strengths and weaknesses of current radiomics literature pertaining specifically to HCC. From an initial set of 48 articles recovered through database searches, 23 articles were retained to be included in this review after full screening. Among these 23 studies, 7 used a radiomics approach in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Only two studies applied radiomics to positron emission tomography\textendash computed tomography (PET\textendash CT). In the remaining 14 articles, a radiomics analysis was performed on computed tomography (CT). Eight studies dealt with the relationship between biological signatures and imaging findings, and can be classified as radiogenomic studies. For each study included in our review, we computed a Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) as proposed by Lambin et al. We found that the RQS (mean~{$\pm~$}standard deviation) was 8.35 {$\pm$} 5.38 (out of a possible maximum value of 36). Although these scores are fairly low, and radiomics has not yet reached clinical utility in HCC, it is important to underscore the fact that these early studies pave the way for the radiomics field with a focus on HCC. Radiomics is still a very young field, and is far from being mature, but it remains a very promising technology for the future for developing adequate personalized treatment as a non-invasive approach, for complementing or replacing tumor biopsies, as well as for developing novel prognostic biomarkers in HCC patients.},

It finds that globalization losers are more likely to express feelings of economic insecurity. Such feelings, in turn, increase preferences for welfare state expansion, which in turn increase the likelihood of voting for the Social Democratic Party. The analysis also shows that globalization losers and winners differ significantly with regard to their social policy preferences and their propensity to vote for left parties. The article is innovative on two counts: First, it uses a number of different and more nuanced indicators measuring individuals' positions as beneficiaries or losers of increasing global competition. Second, rather than focusing on one particular part of the causal chain, it tests the entire individual-level causal mechanism implied by the compensation hypothesis.]}

Noninvasive imaging plays a critical role in the clinical workflow of liver diseases, but conventional imaging assessment may provide limited information. Accurate detection, characterization and monitoring remain challenging. With progress in quantitative imaging analysis techniques, radiomics emerged as an efficient tool that shows promise to aid in personalized diagnosis and treatment decision-making. Radiomics could reflect the heterogeneity of liver lesions via extracting high-throughput and high-dimensional features from multi-modality imaging. Machine learning algorithms are then used to construct clinical target-oriented imaging biomarkers to assist disease management. Here, we review the methodological process in liver disease radiomics studies in a stepwise fashion from data acquisition and curation, region of interest segmentation, liver-specific feature extraction, to task-oriented modelling. Furthermore, the applications of radiomics in liver diseases are outlined in aspects of diagnosis and staging, evaluation of liver tumour biological behaviours, and prognosis according to different disease type. Finally, we discuss the current limitations of radiomics in liver disease studies and explore its future opportunities.},

In this sophisticated examination of the HBO serial drama that aired from 2002 until 2008, Linda Williams, a leading film scholar and authority on the interplay between film, melodrama, and issues of race, suggests what exactly it is that makes The Wire so good. She argues that while the series is a powerful exploration of urban dysfunction and institutional failure, its narrative power derives from its genre. The Wire is popular melodrama, not Greek tragedy, as critics and the series creator David Simon have claimed. Entertaining, addictive, funny, and despairing all at once, it is a serial melodrama grounded in observation of Baltimore's people and institutions: of cops and criminals, schools and blue-collar labor, local government and local journalism. The Wire transforms close observation into an unparalleled melodrama by juxtaposing the good and evil of individuals with the good and evil of institutions.},

Despite the tone of Wacquant?s review, we feel that he made a contribution in raising important issues about the role of theory in ethnography. The responses to his review that address this issue, especially those by Anderson and Duneier, are also important because they help to broaden our understanding of how theory is used in ethnographic research. What we take from this exchange is that good ethnography is theory driven, and is likely to be much more reflective of inductive theoretical insights than those that are purely deductive. Moreover, we show that in some ethnographic studies the theoretical insights are neither strictly deductive nor inductive, but represent a combination of both.},

I try to show that xenophobic and racist views of the social world are not instrumental to a fight for scarce jobs or housing. Neither is it appropriate to interpret them as a result of a culture clash that is caused by migratory movements across countries and continents. They are not mere radicalizations of the discourse of exclusion and devaluation which political and administrative elites generate and institutionalize, for example, in immigration policies. Starting from the insights of this critical review, I shall develop the hypothesis that xenophobia and racism should be seen as appeals tothe pact of solidarity into which state and society have entered in modern nation-states and which in times of intensified social conflicts seems fragile in the eyes of downwardly mobile groups. The xenophobic discourse serves not only to reassure identity when nationalistic self-images run into crisis but is an element of a political struggle about whohas the right tobe cared for by the state and society: a fight for the collective goods of the modern state.},

METHODS: A total of 89 untreated LI-RADS-graded liver tumors (35 LR-3, 14 LR-4, and 40 LR-5) were identified based on the radiology MRI interpretation reports. Multiphase 3D T1-weighted gradient echo imaging was acquired at six time points: pre-contrast, four phases immediately post-contrast, and one hepatobiliary phase after intravenous injection of gadoxetate disodium. Image co-registration was performed across all phases on the center tumor slice to correct motion. A rectangular tumor box centered on the tumor area was drawn to extract subset tumor images for each imaging phase, which were used as the inputs to a convolutional neural network (CNN). The pre-trained AlexNet CNN model underwent transfer learning using liver MRI data for LI-RADS tumor grade classification. The output probability number closer to 1 or 0 indicated a higher possibility of being combined LR-4/LR-5 tumor or LR-3 tumor, respectively. Five-fold cross validation was used for training (60\% dataset), validation (20\%) and testing processes (20\%). RESULTS: The DL CNN model for LI-RADS grading using inputs of multiphase liver MRI data acquired at three time points (pre-contrast, arterial, and washout phase) achieved a high accuracy of 0.90, sensitivity of 1.0, precision of 0.835, and AUC of 0.95 with reference to the expert human radiologist report. The CNN output of probability provided radiologists a confidence level of the model's grading for each liver lesion. CONCLUSIONS: An AlexNet CNN model for LI-RADS grading of liver lesions provided diagnostic performance comparable to radiologists and offered valuable clinical guidance for differentiating intermediate LR-3 liver lesions from more-likely malignant LR-4/LR-5 lesions in HCC diagnosis.},

Risk factors for HCC include chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C, alcohol addiction, metabolic liver disease (particularly nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) and exposure to dietary toxins such as aflatoxins and aristolochic acid. All these risk factors are potentially preventable, highlighting the considerable potential of risk prevention for decreasing the global burden of HCC. HCC surveillance and early detection increase the chance of potentially curative treatment; however, HCC surveillance is substantially underutilized, even in countries with sufficient medical resources. Early-stage HCC can be treated curatively by local ablation, surgical resection or liver transplantation. Treatment selection depends on tumour characteristics, the severity of underlying liver dysfunction, age, other medical comorbidities, and available medical resources and local expertise. Catheter-based locoregional treatment is used in patients with intermediate-stage cancer. Kinase and immune checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to be effective treatment options in patients with advanced-stage HCC. Together, rational deployment of prevention, attainment of global goals for viral hepatitis eradication, and improvements in HCC surveillance and therapy hold promise for achieving a substantial reduction in the worldwide HCC burden within the next few decades.},

  abstract = {Purpose To investigate diagnostic performance by using a deep learning method with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the differentiation of liver masses at dynamic contrast agent-enhanced computed tomography (CT). Materials and Methods This clinical retrospective study used CT image sets of liver masses over three phases (noncontrast-agent enhanced, arterial, and delayed). Masses were diagnosed according to five categories (category A, classic hepatocellular carcinomas [HCCs]; category B, malignant liver tumors other than classic and early HCCs; category C, indeterminate masses or mass-like lesions [including early HCCs and dysplastic nodules] and rare benign liver masses other than hemangiomas and cysts; category D, hemangiomas; and category E, cysts). Supervised training was performed by using 55 536 image sets obtained in 2013 (from 460 patients, 1068 sets were obtained and they were augmented by a factor of 52 [rotated, parallel-shifted, strongly enlarged, and noise-added images were generated from the original images]). The CNN was composed of six convolutional, three maximum pooling, and three fully connected layers. The CNN was tested with 100 liver mass image sets obtained in 2016 (74 men and 26 women; mean age, 66.4 years {$\pm$} 10.6 [standard deviation]; mean mass size, 26.9 mm {$\pm$} 25.9; 21, nine, 35, 20, and 15 liver masses for categories A, B, C, D, and E, respectively). Training and testing were performed five times. Accuracy for categorizing liver masses with CNN model and the area under receiver operating characteristic curve for differentiating categories A-B versus categories C-E were calculated. Results Median accuracy of differential diagnosis of liver masses for test data were 0.84. Median area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for differentiating categories A-B from C-E was 0.92. Conclusion Deep learning with CNN showed high diagnostic performance in differentiation of liver masses at dynamic CT. \textcopyright{} RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.},

The article shows what counterfactual Indian and Israeli legislatures would look like if seats were allocated using electoral districts of varying magnitudes and highlights how parties with geographically concentrated support bases win similar seat totals, irrespective of district magnitude.},

  abstract = {Background Radiomic features may quantify characteristics present in medical imaging. However, the lack of standardized definitions and validated reference values have hampered clinical use. Purpose To standardize a set of 174 radiomic features. Materials and Methods Radiomic features were assessed in three phases. In phase I, 487 features were derived from the basic set of 174 features. Twenty-five research teams with unique radiomics software implementations computed feature values directly from a digital phantom, without any additional image processing. In phase II, 15 teams computed values for 1347 derived features using a CT image of a patient with lung cancer and predefined image processing configurations. In both phases, consensus among the teams on the validity of tentative reference values was measured through the frequency of the modal value and classified as follows: less than three matches, weak; three to five matches, moderate; six to nine matches, strong; 10 or more matches, very strong. In the final phase (phase III), a public data set of multimodality images (CT, fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and T1-weighted MRI) from 51 patients with soft-tissue sarcoma was used to prospectively assess reproducibility of standardized features. Results Consensus on reference values was initially weak for 232 of 302 features (76.8\%) at phase I and 703 of 1075 features (65.4\%) at phase II. At the final iteration, weak consensus remained for only two of 487 features (0.4\%) at phase I and 19 of 1347 features (1.4\%) at phase II. Strong or better consensus was achieved for 463 of 487 features (95.1\%) at phase I and 1220 of 1347 features (90.6\%) at phase II. Overall, 169 of 174 features were standardized in the first two phases. In the final validation phase (phase III), most of the 169 standardized features could be excellently reproduced (166 with CT; 164 with PET; and 164 with MRI). Conclusion A set of 169 radiomics features was standardized, which enabled verification and calibration of different radiomics software. \textcopyright{} RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.
